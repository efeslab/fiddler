These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities.

By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> This is part 5 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to "acknowledged". 17. Section 3. Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to

I can see the red from car tail lights I pull out my camera and take a picture to get the blurry rush of cars as my phone wallpaper. Compared to where I am from in Africa, the infrastructure here is quite advanced, but at least I can say we are not that far behind. But indeed, this is a magnificent city. ~ Woke up in excitement to try out a new restaurant in this City. Hurriedly enjoyed breakfast and took a taxi to a local coffee house. The donuts as well as the coffee were better than any other that I have ever tasted. All I can say is that was the best cafe because all the other coffee houses couldn\'t match the first one.

She is so majestic and big. I went up to the top where I could see the whole bay area. The food here is so diverse as well. I had three different cultures of food for all my meals. I know this is cliche but I Love New York! ~ On the 25th of October 2022, I visited New York City. At 7:20 AM, I checked into Room Mate Grace Hotel Pool. The next stop after about an hour was the central park. I enjoyed the green nature of the park. I left Central Park for the MOMA museum around 11:20 AM. The museum tour took the greater part of the day. I enjoyed the rich history that the museum carries. What other better place to wind up the end than the Statue of Liberty? ~ A Visit to New York21st October 2022- I visited the Statue of Liberty and learned about the establishment year22nd October 2022- I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has three sites and the establishment year is 1870.I had interesting moments , they formed part of my memories. ~ The streets are filled early in the morning as people scramble to go to work. I am here watching all these tall buildings. I am in downtown Manhattan. I decide to enter this fancy coffee shop and take some coffee to start my touring day. I am graced by the face of this gorgeous man and have butterflies in my stomach. This really marked the beginning of a great day. ~ Finally my dream of visiting New York comes a reality.My first experience of arriving in this wonderful town cant be explained in a single day. All the things in the city are wonderful.I will never forget every part of the good things I found there. ~ Day 1 just woke up and I am already too excited about seeing those skyscrapers I heard of, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire state and many more. Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking. Not even a single litter on the streets. It must have taken everyone\'s effort to achieve this. ~ New York. 25-10-2022I am having a great time in New York since I am able to visit places such as iconic Statue of Liberty which I have always seen in movies only. It is quite a spectacle. ~ What a day! I have to walk like a New Yorker not to stand out. The traffic in the city is blooming, the buildings got me going in circles, I got lost. New York is a place to be though, i totally love the food here. ~ December 22, 2022 Visiting New York for the holidays and unexpectedly saw my long-lost ex-girlfriend. We greeted each other and hang out for a while. During our talk, our memories just flash in my mind. We visited the statue of liberty and central park. I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

INFO:root:input text: ['\\section{Methods} This section introduces HAMLET, a framework for \\textbf{H}ardware-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{M}odular \\textbf{L}east \\textbf{E}xpensive \\textbf{T}raining. %We employ state-of-the-art UDA methods~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer, dacs}. We design a novel framework to tackle online domain adaptation with real-time performance. We tackle this problem with several synergistic strategies. First, we introduce a Hardware-Aware Modular Training (HAMT) agent able to optimize online a trade-off between model accuracy and adaptation time. HAMT allows us to significantly reduce online training time and GFlops. Nevertheless, the cheapest training consists of not training at all. Therefore, as the second strategy, we introduce a formal geometric model of online domain shifts that enable reliable domain shift detection and domain estimator signals (Adaptive Domain Detection, Sec.~\\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}). These can be easily integrated to activate the adaptation process only at specific times, \\textit{as least as possible}. Moreover, we can further leverage these signals by designing adaptive training policies that dynamically adapt domain-sensitive hyperparameters. We refer to these methodologies as Active Training Modulation. We present an overview of HAMLET in Fig.~\\ref{fig:architecture}. \\subsection{Model setup} We employ DAFormer~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer} as our starting point, coupling state-of-the-art UDA methods~\\cite{dacs} with SegFormer~\\cite{xie2021segformer} as segmentation backbone -- this latter because it brings strong generalization capacity. The student model is assisted by two teachers during training: an EMA teacher (updated as exponential-moving-average of the student) and a static source-pretrained model. The student is fed with images mixing target and source, and supervised with a ``mixed-sample" loss computed against labels mixing EMA teacher pseudo-labels and source annotations (pseudo-loss). To regularize the student, we also employ a feature distance loss with the static teacher and a supervised loss, both computed using source samples stored in a replay buffer.%\\matteo{On top of it, we introduce our contributions.} \\subsection{Hardware-aware modular training (HAMT)} \\label{subs:hardware-aware-modular-training} Online adaption requires updates of the parameters during deployment time. However, back-propagation is computationally expensive and hence too slow to be continuously applied on a deployed agent. Opting for a partial weight update, for example finetuning the last module of the network, would enable much better training time. Nevertheless, domain shifts can manifest as changes in both the data input distribution (attributes of the images, \\eg{} day/night) and the output distribution (\\eg{} classes priors). These information could be encoded in different parts of the network, therefore just updating the very last segment might not suffice. This motivates a need to orchestrate the training process, to ensure sufficient training while minimizing the computational overhead. Inspired by reward-punishment~\\cite{tonioni2019real} and reinforcement learning~\\cite{wang2018haq} policies, we introduce an orchestration agent in charge of deciding how deeply the network shall be fine-tuned as a trade-off between the pseudo-loss minimization rate and the computational time. In contrast to previous efficient back-propagation approaches~\\cite{wei2017minimal, jiang2019accelerating, cheng2022stochastic}, our model is pretrained on the task and thus requires smaller updates to adapt. Let us start by modeling the problem. Our model backbone, $f$, is composed of four different modules: $ %\\begin{equation} f = m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3 \\circ m\\_2 \\circ m\\_1 %\\end{equation} $. This defines our action space $\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\mathrm{T\\_1}, \\mathrm{T\\_2}, \\mathrm{T\\_3}, \\mathrm{T\\_4}\\}$ where $\\mathrm{T\\_4}$ corresponds to training just the last module of the network, $m\\_4$, while $\\mathrm{T\\_3}$ the last two modules, \\ie{} $m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3$, $\\mathrm{T\\_2}$ the last three, \\ie{} $m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3 \\circ m\\_2$, and $\\mathrm{T\\_1}$ the whole network $f$. We also define a continuous state space $\\mathcal{S}=\\{\\mathrm{R}, \\mathrm{V}\\}$ where $\\mathrm{R}$ is the second derivative of the EMA teacher pseudo-loss over time-steps, hence $\\mathrm{R}=-\\frac{d^2 l}{d t^2}$. $\\mathrm{V}$ represents instead a cumulative rewards vector with the same dimension as the action space $\\mathcal{A}$, initialized at zero. Now we have everything in place to employ an expected-improvement based decision model. At every time step $t$ we select the action as $a\\_t = T\\_j | j = \\operatorname\\*{argmax} \\mathrm{V\\_t}$. In the training step $\\mathrm{t}$, $\\mathrm{V\\_j}$ is updated as { \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:naive\\_update} \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t+1}} = R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) \\end{equation} } where $\\alpha$ is a smoothing factor, \\textit{\\eg{}} $0.1$. Since $R\\_t$ represents the negative acceleration of the pseudo-loss of a given instant $t$ and $\\mathrm{V\\_{t}}$ is updated as an integration over $t$ of $R\\_t$, we can see $\\mathrm{V\\_{t}}$ as the expected pseudo-loss negative velocity, $ - \\frac{d l}{d t}$. Therefore, our policy can be seen as a greedy module selection based on the expected pseudo-loss reduction maximization. A notable drawback of this policy is that we will inevitably converge towards picking more rewarding, yet expensive, actions \\ie{} $\\mathrm{T\\_1}, \\mathrm{T\\_2}$ compared to more efficient but potentially less effective actions \\ie{} $\\mathrm{T\\_3}, \\mathrm{T\\_4}$. However, our goal is not to maximize $ - \\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta t}$ where $\\Delta t$ is the number of updates, our goal is instead to maximize $ - \\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta \\tau}$ where $\\Delta \\tau$ is a real time interval. Therefore, we have to introduce in the optimization policy some notion of the actual training cost of each action in $\\mathcal{A}$ on the target device. To start with, we measure the training time associated with each action, obtaining $\\omega\\_T = \\{ \\omega\\_{T\\_1}, \\omega\\_{T\\_2}, \\omega\\_{T\\_3}, \\omega\\_{T\\_4} \\}$. With this we can compute the time-conditioning vector $\\gamma$ as { \\small \\begin{equation} \\gamma\\_i=\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega\\_{T\\_i}} }}{\\sum\\_{j=1}^K e^{\\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega\\_{T\\_j}}}} \\quad \\text{ for } i=1, \\ldots, K \\end{equation} } where $\\beta$ is the softmax temperature, and $K$ the number of actions, \\ie{} 4 in our model. Therefore, we modify our update policy to favor less computationally expensive modules by scaling the updates with $\\gamma$, so that Eq.~\\ref{eq:naive\\_update} becomes: { \\small \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t+1}} = \\begin{cases} \\gamma\\_j R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) & \\textrm{if } R\\_t \\geq 0\\\\ (1 - \\gamma\\_j) R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) & \\textrm{if } R\\_t < 0\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation} } This policy makes it so that more expensive actions receive smaller rewards and larger punishments. Despite its simplicity, this leads to a significant reduction in FLOPS for an average back-propagation $\\beta$, \\ie{} $-30\\%$ with $\\beta=2.75$ or $-43\\%$ with $\\beta=1$. We finally choose $\\beta=1.75$ to obtain a FLOPS reduction of $-34\\%$. Extensive ablations are presented in the \\textbf{supplementary material}. \\subsection{Active training modulation} \\label{subs:active-training-modulation} Continuous and test-time adaptation methods tackle online learning as a continuous and constant process carried out on the data stream. Nevertheless, this approach presents several shortcomings when it comes to real-world deployments. Performing adaptation when the deployment domain is unchanged does not lead to further performance improvements on the current domain; instead, might cause significant forgetting on previous domains, hence hindering model generalization (we present evidence of this in the \\textbf{supplementary material}). Moreover, even if mitigated with Hardware-Aware Modular Training, online training remains a computationally expensive procedure. However, knowing when and what kind of adaptation is needed is not a trivial task. We tackle this by introducing an Adaptive Domain Detector mechanism, Sec.~\\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}, and then a set of strategies to reduce the training time while optimizing the learning rate accordingly, Sec.~\\ref{subs:learning-rate-scheduling}. \\subsubsection{Adaptive domain detection} \\label{subs:adaptive-domain-detection} A key element of the online adaptation system consists of acquiring awareness of the trajectory in the data distribution space, \\ie{} domains, described by the student model during deployment. We can model the problem by setting the trajectory origin in the source domain. With high dimensional data, the data distribution is not tractable, therefore the trajectory model cannot be described in closed form. Nevertheless, recent work~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022} introduced the notion of distance between the current deployed domain and source by approximating it with the confidence drop of a source pretrained model. This approach heavily relies on the assumption that the pretrained model is well calibrated. While this might hold for domains close to source, the calibration quickly degrades in farther domains~\\cite{shift, Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}. This myopic behavior limits the simple use of confidence for domain detection. Furthermore, the additional forward pass on a pretrained model significantly increases the computational cost during deployment. We tackle these limitations with an equivalently simple, yet more robust, approach. We modify the backbone of the static teacher model used for feature distance loss $f^\\text{fd}$ by connecting an extremely lightweight segmentation head, $d^\\text{fd}\\_{1}$, after the first encoder module $m\\_{1}^\\text{fd}$: $ %\\begin{equation} h^\\text{fd}\\_{1} = d^\\text{fd}\\_{1} \\circ m^\\text{fd}\\_{1} %\\end{equation} $. This additional decoder, $h^\\text{fd}\\_{1}$, is trained offline, on source data, without propagating gradients in the backbone architecture. Instead of relying on the confidence of this model, given a target sample $x\\_T$, we propose to compute the cross-entropy between the one-hot encoded student prediction $p(x\\_T) = 1\\_{\\operatorname\\*{argmax}(f(x\\_T))}$ and the lightweight decoder prediction $g(x\\_T) = h^\\text{fd}\\_{1}(x\\_T)$ as \\begin{equation} %L\\_T^{(i)}=-\\sum\\_{j=1}^{H \\times W} \\sum\\_{c=1}^C p\\_T^{(i, j, c)} \\log g\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right)^{(j, c)} % This should also work, whatever you prefer H\\_T^{(i)}=-\\sum\\_{j=1}^{H \\times W} \\sum\\_{c=1}^C p\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right) \\left.\\log g\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right)\\right|\\_{j,c} \\end{equation} Thanks to higher generalization capability (both due to larger number of parameters and unsupervised adaptation process), the student model will always outperform the lightweight decoder head. Nevertheless, since now the distance is measured in the prediction space, we are not subjected to model miscalibration. Furthermore, since the student model is in constant adaptation, the domain distance accuracy actually improves over time, leading to better results. We present evidence of these claims in the \\textbf{supplementary material}. We can now define a denoised signal by using bin-averaging $A\\_T^{(i)}=\\sum\\_{j=mi}^{m(i+1)-1}\\frac{H\\_T^{(j)}}{m}$ where $m$ is the bin size. Then, new domains are modeled as discretized steps of $A\\_T^{(i)}$ as { \\small \\begin{equation} B\\_0 = A\\_0 \\qquad B\\_i = \\begin{cases} A\\_i & \\textrm{if $|B\\_i - A\\_i|>z$} \\\\ B\\_{i-1} & \\textrm{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation} } Where $B$ is the discretized signal and $z$ is the minimum distance used to identify new domains. Finally, we can model the signed amplitude of domain shifts as $S\\_i = B\\_i - B\\_{i-1}$. % \\subsubsection{Least Training and Adaptive Learning Rate} \\label{subs:learning-rate-scheduling} %Now that we have set forth a framework able to express a notion of the current domain, $B$, and occurring domain shifts, $ S$, as a quantitative signals, we can finally control the training phases of the model accordingly. Given the definitions of $B$, and $S$, we can control the training phases accordingly. %First, We decide to trigger the adaptation only when facing a new domain, in a \\textit{Least Training} fashion (LT), \\ie{} when $|S\\_i| > 0$. %and to and orchestrate other training parameters. %Furthermore, we can now go one step further and orchestrate other training parameters. Moreover, we employ an Adaptive Learning Rate strategy (ALR), to orchestrate the other training parameters. Online learning performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate, $\\eta$, learning rate decaying rate, and number of iterations $l$. We can operate on them to ease adaptation according to the specific domain shift we are facing. For instance, the larger the domain shift, \\ie{} $|S\\_i|$, the more we need to adapt to counter its effect -- either by running more optimization steps or using higher learning rate. While if we are moving to domains closer to source, fewer adaptation steps will be necessary. Here we present some policies able to boost online learning performances both in accuracy and FPS. For this purpose we need to define a few signals synchronized with the iterations of the network, namely: $\\eta\\_j$ which contains the learning rate at iteration $j$; $l\\_j$ which contains the iteration when the network started training; $L\\_j$ which contains the iteration when the network is expected to stop training. Note that $mi \\leqslant j < m(i+1)$ and $l\\_j \\leqslant j \\leqslant L\\_j$. By convention, we specify that the training is inhibited whenever $l\\_j = L\\_j$. \\subsubsection{Dynamic ClassMix (DCM)} ClassMix~\\cite{olsson2021classmix} provides a simple mechanism for data augmentation by mixing classes from the source dataset into target images. Usually 50\\% of the classes in the source dataset are selected, however we notice that this percentage is a highly sensitive hyperparameter in online domain adaptation. Injecting a significant portion of source classes has a beneficial impact when adapting to domains closer to the source domain, whereas when adapting to domains further from the source the opposite effect can be observed, as it effectively slows down the adaptation process. We therefore exploit once more the deployment domain awareness to control the mixing augmentation: % THIS IS THE PROBLEM, KEEP THE TWO AWAY! :D (footnotesize is the assassin) % ok - but weird - lol { \\footnotesize \\begin{equation} \\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM} = K\\_{\\text{CM},\\text{min}} + \\frac{(B\\_\\textrm{i}-B\\_\\textrm{source})(K\\_\\textrm{CM,max}-K\\_\\textrm{CM,min})}{B\\_\\textrm{hard}-B\\_\\textrm{source}}. \\end{equation} } where $\\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM}$ is the percentage of source classes used during adaptation; and $K\\_\\textrm{CM, min}$ (resp. $K\\_\\textrm{CM, max}$) is the value of $\\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM}$ assigned when the network is close to (resp. far away from) the source domain. \\subsubsection{Buffer sampling} Following~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}, to simulate real deployment, we limit our accessibility to the source domain by using a replay buffer. Additionally, instead of initializing at random (with uniform prior), we apply Rare Class Sampling (RCS) (skewed priors) as in~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer}. This incentives a more balanced class distribution over the buffer, ultimately leading to better accuracy.']
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> \section{Methods} This section introduces HAMLET, a framework for \textbf{H}ardware-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}odular \textbf{L}east \textbf{E}xpensive \textbf{T}raining. %We employ state-of-the-art UDA methods~\cite{hoyer2021daformer, dacs}. We design a novel framework to tackle online domain adaptation with real-time performance. We tackle this problem with several synergistic strategies. First, we introduce a Hardware-Aware Modular Training (HAMT) agent able to optimize online a trade-off between model accuracy and adaptation time. HAMT allows us to significantly reduce online training time and GFlops. Nevertheless, the cheapest training consists of not training at all. Therefore, as the second strategy, we introduce a formal geometric model of online domain shifts that enable reliable domain shift detection and domain estimator signals (Adaptive Domain Detection, Sec.~\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}). These can be easily integrated to activate the adaptation process only at specific times, \textit{as least as possible}. Moreover, we can further leverage these signals by designing adaptive training policies that dynamically adapt domain-sensitive hyperparameters. We refer to these methodologies as Active Training Modulation. We present an overview of HAMLET in Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}. \subsection{Model setup} We employ DAFormer~\cite{hoyer2021daformer} as our starting point, coupling state-of-the-art UDA methods~\cite{dacs} with SegFormer~\cite{xie2021segformer} as segmentation backbone -- this latter because it brings strong generalization capacity. The student model is assisted by two teachers during training: an EMA teacher (updated as exponential-moving-average of the student) and a static source-pretrained model. The student is fed with images mixing target and source, and supervised with a ``mixed-sample" loss computed against labels mixing EMA teacher pseudo-labels and source annotations (pseudo-loss). To regularize the student, we also employ a feature distance loss with the static teacher and a supervised loss, both computed using source samples stored in a replay buffer.%\matteo{On top of it, we introduce our contributions.} \subsection{Hardware-aware modular training (HAMT)} \label{subs:hardware-aware-modular-training} Online adaption requires updates of the parameters during deployment time. However, back-propagation is computationally expensive and hence too slow to be continuously applied on a deployed agent. Opting for a partial weight update, for example finetuning the last module of the network, would enable much better training time. Nevertheless, domain shifts can manifest as changes in both the data input distribution (attributes of the images, \eg{} day/night) and the output distribution (\eg{} classes priors). These information could be encoded in different parts of the network, therefore just updating the very last segment might not suffice. This motivates a need to orchestrate the training process, to ensure sufficient training while minimizing the computational overhead. Inspired by reward-punishment~\cite{tonioni2019real} and reinforcement learning~\cite{wang2018haq} policies, we introduce an orchestration agent in charge of deciding how deeply the network shall be fine-tuned as a trade-off between the pseudo-loss minimization rate and the computational time. In contrast to previous efficient back-propagation approaches~\cite{wei2017minimal, jiang2019accelerating, cheng2022stochastic}, our model is pretrained on the task and thus requires smaller updates to adapt. Let us start by modeling the problem. Our model backbone, $f$, is composed of four different modules: $ %\begin{equation} f = m\_4 \circ m\_3 \circ m\_2 \circ m\_1 %\end{equation} $. This defines our action space $\mathcal{A}=\{\mathrm{T\_1}, \mathrm{T\_2}, \mathrm{T\_3}, \mathrm{T\_4}\}$ where $\mathrm{T\_4}$ corresponds to training just the last module of the network, $m\_4$, while $\mathrm{T\_3}$ the last two modules, \ie{} $m\_4 \circ m\_3$, $\mathrm{T\_2}$ the last three, \ie{} $m\_4 \circ m\_3 \circ m\_2$, and $\mathrm{T\_1}$ the whole network $f$. We also define a continuous state space $\mathcal{S}=\{\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{V}\}$ where $\mathrm{R}$ is the second derivative of the EMA teacher pseudo-loss over time-steps, hence $\mathrm{R}=-\frac{d^2 l}{d t^2}$. $\mathrm{V}$ represents instead a cumulative rewards vector with the same dimension as the action space $\mathcal{A}$, initialized at zero. Now we have everything in place to employ an expected-improvement based decision model. At every time step $t$ we select the action as $a\_t = T\_j | j = \operatorname\*{argmax} \mathrm{V\_t}$. In the training step $\mathrm{t}$, $\mathrm{V\_j}$ is updated as { \begin{equation} \label{eq:naive\_update} \mathrm{V\_{j,t+1}} = R\_t \alpha + \mathrm{V\_{j,t}} (1 - \alpha) \end{equation} } where $\alpha$ is a smoothing factor, \textit{\eg{}} $0.1$. Since $R\_t$ represents the negative acceleration of the pseudo-loss of a given instant $t$ and $\mathrm{V\_{t}}$ is updated as an integration over $t$ of $R\_t$, we can see $\mathrm{V\_{t}}$ as the expected pseudo-loss negative velocity, $ - \frac{d l}{d t}$. Therefore, our policy can be seen as a greedy module selection based on the expected pseudo-loss reduction maximization. A notable drawback of this policy is that we will inevitably converge towards picking more rewarding, yet expensive, actions \ie{} $\mathrm{T\_1}, \mathrm{T\_2}$ compared to more efficient but potentially less effective actions \ie{} $\mathrm{T\_3}, \mathrm{T\_4}$. However, our goal is not to maximize $ - \frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}$ where $\Delta t$ is the number of updates, our goal is instead to maximize $ - \frac{\Delta l}{\Delta \tau}$ where $\Delta \tau$ is a real time interval. Therefore, we have to introduce in the optimization policy some notion of the actual training cost of each action in $\mathcal{A}$ on the target device. To start with, we measure the training time associated with each action, obtaining $\omega\_T = \{ \omega\_{T\_1}, \omega\_{T\_2}, \omega\_{T\_3}, \omega\_{T\_4} \}$. With this we can compute the time-conditioning vector $\gamma$ as { \small \begin{equation} \gamma\_i=\frac{e^{\frac{1}{\beta\omega\_{T\_i}} }}{\sum\_{j=1}^K e^{\frac{1}{\beta\omega\_{T\_j}}}} \quad \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, K \end{equation} } where $\beta$ is the softmax temperature, and $K$ the number of actions, \ie{} 4 in our model. Therefore, we modify our update policy to favor less computationally expensive modules by scaling the updates with $\gamma$, so that Eq.~\ref{eq:naive\_update} becomes: { \small \begin{equation} \mathrm{V\_{j,t+1}} = \begin{cases} \gamma\_j R\_t \alpha + \mathrm{V\_{j,t}} (1 - \alpha) & \textrm{if } R\_t \geq 0\\ (1 - \gamma\_j) R\_t \alpha + \mathrm{V\_{j,t}} (1 - \alpha) & \textrm{if } R\_t < 0\\ \end{cases} \end{equation} } This policy makes it so that more expensive actions receive smaller rewards and larger punishments.

Meaning of brand name Ioni is an eco-friendly lifestyle brand that can be used throughout the house, starting with foam-free laundry detergent, deodorization and cleaning. The current brand name, Ioni, comes from the abbreviation of "mineral ion water" into an easy-to-call word. 2. When and when to start the online store Han Seo-yoon, CEO of the suspicious research institute that runs Ioni. Employees working at a natural detergent factory came out and opened an online store. Household sewage is actually the biggest cause of water pollution. It was a bit disappointing that we overlooked that, so we made a product called Ioni and created an online store with the same name as a way to drastically reduce household sewage. It currently produces and supplies Ioni, which is in its fifth year 5. 3. Sales Products and Business Models Ioni undiluted solution is an ultra-high concentrated undiluted solution made of 100% food additives and can be diluted in water. It can be washed, cleaned, and deodorized without bubbles. Bubble is the biggest culprit of water pollution. It researches and introduces various recipes and products so that you can live without foaming surfactants. Plastic containers for undiluted liquids are collected and reused to reduce plastic usage. 4. What was the most difficult thing about operation and how to overcome it? It is not easy to make a profit. We are overcoming this in various ways. For example, since it is a brand that changes the package and actively accepts customers\' opinions, this time it is changing the lid or something like this, or expanding the lineup a little. It is a very safe detergent or a very unfamiliar concept for ordinary consumers. Therefore, after using Ioni since its launch, a free refund system has been implemented if you are dissatisfied. There has never been a refund in five years. 5. A company\'s growth story, including key indicators such as sales and membership numbers. Over the past five years, we\'ve sold 60,000 to 70,000 units. As you can see through Kakao Makers Wadiz, customer satisfaction is almost 95%. The repurchase rate is also about 60 percent. It publishes a report of Eco Social Impact every month. This report introduced a reduction of about 160 million liters of contaminated water and 64 million liters of rinse water from September 2019 to October 2022. In addition, more than 6,000 empty bottles were collected and reused, reducing about 7 tons of plastic. If you collect more than five Ioni bottles, you will receive a 500 won deposit for each bottle when you collect them online for free or return them to a nearby refill station. A reusable package project is underway to reuse these collected empty bottles. 6. A word of advice to anyone who starts an online store. When I interviewed about branding, I talked about small brands. I don\'t think even the value is small just because it\'s small. Although we are a very small company now, I think we are doing very, very valuable things, so anyone who wants to share these values \u200b\u200band philosophies can create and run a brand. I don\'t want anyone to be afraid to start. 7. Differentiating points from competitive brands It can be washed in large quantities with very small amounts. Our Ioni detergent can be used in hand laundry or washing machines, starting with sterilization of laundry tanks. It is competitive compared to the fact that the detergent industry has increased its volume and is dividing and selling it by detergent use. It provides a recipe that can make up to 30,000 liters of deodorized water with one liter of Ioni original Ioni detergent. In addition, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as cleaning fruits and vegetables or deodorizing water for pets. 8. Proud partnership or attraction investment We are continuously working with these companies to reduce carbon emissions, eco-related events, and cooperation with such companies. Not too long ago, I gave a lecture at a university student named Inactors, and a student at Ewha Womans University who found out about our product said that he wanted to run a pop-up store in Ewha Womans University, so we did a pop -up store. 9. Future growth strategies and expansion plans for the company It started for home use, but it is estimated that less than 1% of it will be used in Korea. If you do laundry only once a day at home, you will discharge about 84 liters of contaminated water. At least 84 liters of contaminated water can be reduced by running the washing machine once a day in each household and once a day in each household. Our dream is to reduce the amount of contaminated water by changing it to such an eco-friendly detergent, even if it is not our Ioni, even if it is only 10% of Korea. 10. Plans for overseas expansion We went to an early childhood fair in Jakarta, Indonesia, and it was so popular that we had a meeting with many buyers. Many companies have contacted us in Japan, so we are planning to export a little to Japan this time. 11. The reason why Cafe 24 was chosen as the online store construction platform. I don\'t have to tell you this, but I think everyone knows. Cafe24 was also the largest hosting company in Korea and it was good in that it could implement almost all the functions I wanted. At first, free templates and things like that were very well done and I liked that there was a responsive template. The design is... We don\'t have a designer in our company. We\'re even designing it ourselves. There are many things to change the detail page from time to time, but if you use Edibot, you can easily and easily change and create the detail page even if you can\'t handle design tools, so I chose Cafe24 in that regard.번역결과The following are questions and answers from an interview with the CEO of eco-friendly detergent brand ‘Ioni’, a Cafe24 customer.

Meaning of brand name Ioni is an eco-friendly lifestyle brand that can be used throughout the house, starting with foam-free laundry detergent, deodorization and cleaning. The current brand name, Ioni, comes from the abbreviation of "mineral ion water" into an easy-to-call word. 2. When and when to start the online store Han Seo-yoon, CEO of the suspicious research institute that runs Ioni. Employees working at a natural detergent factory came out and opened an online store. Household sewage is actually the biggest cause of water pollution. It was a bit disappointing that we overlooked that, so we made a product called Ioni and created an online store with the same name as a way to drastically reduce household sewage. It currently produces and supplies Ioni, which is in its fifth year 5. 3. Sales Products and Business Models Ioni undiluted solution is an ultra-high concentrated undiluted solution made of 100% food additives and can be diluted in water. It can be washed, cleaned, and deodorized without bubbles. Bubble is the biggest culprit of water pollution. It researches and introduces various recipes and products so that you can live without foaming surfactants. Plastic containers for undiluted liquids are collected and reused to reduce plastic usage. 4. What was the most difficult thing about operation and how to overcome it? It is not easy to make a profit. We are overcoming this in various ways. For example, since it is a brand that changes the package and actively accepts customers' opinions, this time it is changing the lid or something like this, or expanding the lineup a little. It is a very safe detergent or a very unfamiliar concept for ordinary consumers. Therefore, after using Ioni since its launch, a free refund system has been implemented if you are dissatisfied. There has never been a refund in five years. 5. A company's growth story, including key indicators such as sales and membership numbers. Over the past five years, we've sold 60,000 to 70,000 units. As you can see through Kakao Makers Wadiz, customer satisfaction is almost 95%. The repurchase rate is also about 60 percent. It publishes a report of Eco Social Impact every month. This report introduced a reduction of about 160 million liters of contaminated water and 64 million liters of rinse water from September 2019 to October 2022. In addition, more than 6,000 empty bottles were collected and reused, reducing about 7 tons of plastic. If you collect more than five Ioni bottles, you will receive a 500 won deposit for each bottle when you collect them online for free or return them to a nearby refill station. A reusable package project is underway to reuse these collected empty bottles. 6. A word of advice to anyone who starts an online store. When I interviewed about branding, I talked about small brands. I don't think even the value is small just because it's small. Although we are a very small company now, I think we are doing very, very valuable things, so anyone who wants to share these values ​​and philosophies can create and run a brand. I don't want anyone to be afraid to start. 7. Differentiating points from competitive brands It can be washed in large quantities with very small amounts. Our Ioni detergent can be used in hand laundry or washing machines, starting with sterilization of laundry tanks. It is competitive compared to the fact that the detergent industry has increased its volume and is dividing and selling it by detergent use. It provides a recipe that can make up to 30,000 liters of deodorized water with one liter of Ioni original Ioni detergent. In addition, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as cleaning fruits and vegetables or deodorizing water for pets. 8. Proud partnership or attraction investment We are continuously working with these companies to reduce carbon emissions, eco-related events, and cooperation with such companies. Not too long ago, I gave a lecture at a university student named Inactors, and a student at Ewha Womans University who found out about our product said that he wanted to run a pop-up store in Ewha Womans University, so we did a pop -up store. 9. Future growth strategies and expansion plans for the company It started for home use, but it is estimated that less than 1% of it will be used in Korea. If you do laundry only once a day at home, you will discharge about 84 liters of contaminated water. At least 84 liters of contaminated water can be reduced by running the washing machine once a day in each household and once a day in each household. Our dream is to reduce the amount of contaminated water by changing it to such an eco-friendly detergent, even if it is not our Ioni, even if it is only 10% of Korea. 10. Plans for overseas expansion We went to an early childhood fair in Jakarta, Indonesia, and it was so popular that we had a meeting with many buyers. Many companies have contacted us in Japan, so we are planning to export a little to Japan this time. 11. The reason why Cafe 24 was chosen as the online store construction platform.

Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK The information in this document is provided as a guide only and is not professional advice, including legal advice.

If such a vehicle is imported from the UK (including via NI), the importer is required to complete a Customs import declaration, pay Customs Duty, if applicable and Value Added Tax (VAT) on import, prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being completed by the NCT centres. Vehicles purchased from NI, that were in NI prior to 1 January 2021, are treated as EU goods and no customs formalities are required and VAT on import and customs duty are not applicable. However, where vehicles from Great Britain (GB) are moved to the EU, through NI, after 31 December 2020, including those re-registered to an NI owner, then customs formalities and VAT on import may apply. Full information on the requirements for importing second-hand vehicles is available on the Revenue website here. An overview of vehicle import scenarios is outlined in Appendix 1. 2 Pre-requirements to make a Customs Import Declaration If a vehicle is imported from the UK, then a customs declaration is required. This is usually completed by a customs agent on behalf of the importer. However, an individual can also complete the declaration using the declaration portal in Revenue’s import system, AIS. To complete a customs import declaration an individual must: \uf0b7 Be registered for Revenue Online Service (ROS) \uf0b7 Be registered for Customs & Excise \uf0b7 Have an EORI number If not already registered for ROS, for example if you are a PAYE employee, then a registration request can be submitted through MyEnquiries. Please include your PPS number and brief note on the reason for the request. This can be submitted through the following path: 1) Sign into MyEnquiries 2) Select \'Add new Enquiry\' 3) In the \'My Enquiry relates to\' section, enter \'Customs\': Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 4 4) In the \'More Specifically\' section, enter \'eCustoms - Systems Query\' for enquiries relating to AEP (Import & Export Declarations), EORI, EMS, NCTS, ICS and CD. If it is not possible to register for MyEnquiries then the request can be sent by e-mail to ecustoms@revenue.ie On receipt, eCustoms will register the applicant for C&E and complete an EORI registration which will enable the import of the motor vehicle. Once registration is confirmed by eCustoms, the next step is to register for ROS on www.revenue.ie . Registration for ROS will provide access to the AIS trader portal and allow submission of an import declaration. If importing a new vehicle into the State, the following information must be attached to the import declaration: \uf0b7 A valid Certificate of Conformity (CoC) that confirms EU type approval. Please note that the type approval number on the CoC must correspond to an EU Member State. or \uf0b7 An Individual Approval or Small Series Approval Certificate issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 5 3 Customs Import Declaration Submission The type of declaration required is a “H1” import declaration Step 1: Log into ROS (guidance here) Step 2: Select the ‘Customs UCC Portal’ under the My Services tab – Other Services Figure 1: ROS Customs UCC Portal Step 3: Follow the guidance on inputting a H1 customs declaration in the Customs UCC Portal here. 4 Combined Nomenclature Code Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes are set out in TARIC. Vehicles are classified for customs purposes under goods code: 8700000000. This will be further broken down by the vehicle type (i.e. motor vehicle – 8703) and then the specifics of the particular vehicle. The CN code is entered at Data Element (DE) 6/15 (Commodity Code – TARIC Code) on the customs import declaration. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 6 The most common vehicle is: 870321 - Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of <10 persons, incl. station wagons and racing cars, with only spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine of a cylinder capacity <= 1.000 cm³ (excl. vehicles for travelling on snow and other specially designed vehicles of subheading 870310). NOTE: there is a different code for new and used vehicles \uf0b7 8703211000 – new vehicle \uf0b7 8703219000– used vehicle 5 Vehicle Identification Number IMPORTANT: The inclusion of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is critical. From 1 January 2021, to enable an imported vehicle to be cleared by the NCT centre, evidence of a customs import declaration must be provided at the NCT centre. There will also be an electronic interface between the NCT centre and the Revenue Customs system, therefore the correct VIN must be entered on the customs import declaration. Procedure at Import: When completing your customs import declaration, at DE 2/3, insert 1D97 followed by the VIN. It should be noted that 1D97 (VIN) should be included at Goods Shipment item level. NOTE: If the item being imported does not have a VIN, please insert the text NOVIN033 after 1D97. 6 Transfer of Residence Persons transferring their residence should include their private vehicles on their Transfer of Residence (TOR) declaration form (C&E 1076), which covers the importation of personal items and household goods from outside the EU. There is more information on how to claim TOR relief on the Revenue website. If an importer qualifies for TOR relief, no Customs Duty or VAT on import is payable on the vehicle(s). If you are personally importing your personal items and household goods and you are physically with the goods, then an electronic customs import declaration may not be necessary. For further assistance contact Customs Clearance and Import or Export Controls on 01-7383685 or through Revenue MyEnquiries. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 7 7 UK Origin Vehicles From 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain, where the relevant rules on origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. However, goods of EU origin that are in use in the UK and that are subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate, as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. Further information on preferential tariff treatment and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 7.1 Where the Vehicle is UK Origin Where the vehicle was manufactured in the UK and complies with the origin terms as set out in the EU-UK TCA, a preferential tariff rate of 0% may be claimed. To claim preferential origin for UK origin goods for release into free circulation in the EU, the following codes are used: \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 4/17 (Preference) should contain the code ‘300’. \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 5/16 (Country of preferential origin) is ‘GB’. \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 2/3 (Documents produced, certificates and authorisations, additional references), one of the following codes should be used: - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a \'statement on origin’ for a single shipment, use code “U116”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on ‘importer’s knowledge’, use code “U117”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a \'statement on origin’ for multiple shipments of identical products, use code “U118”. A list of codes which may be applicable is available in Appendix 2. 8 Returned Goods Relief Returned Goods Relief may be available, subject to conditions, for vehicles that have been exported from the Customs territory of the Union. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3 rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are: Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 8 \uf0b7 The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU \uf0b7 Must not have been altered and \uf0b7 Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. Further information on the relief and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 9 Postponed Accounting for VAT Postponed accounting for VAT on import is now available to all VAT registered traders. Revenue may exclude traders who do not fulfil certain conditions and requirements from using this scheme. This scheme: \uf0b7 provides for postponed accounting for VAT on imports from non-EU countries \uf0b7 enables you to account for import VAT on your VAT return \uf0b7 allows you to reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared in a return. This is subject to normal rules on deductibility. More information on postponed accounting is available here. 10 Importing a Vehicle from Northern Ireland Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods. The result is that there are no Customs formalities, including Customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, in January 2021, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used vehicles imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain, and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. A vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has remained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations. However, proof of the vehicle’s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 will be required, for example: \uf0b7 a ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle \uf0b7 a copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 9 \uf0b7 tax and insurance details indicating use in NI prior to 1 January 2021 or \uf0b7 a copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021. Where a second-hand vehicle has been imported from Great Britain after 31 December 2020 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on Import on Used Vehicles must be made to Revenue in respect of any vehicles that qualify for the UK VAT margin scheme. If you do not have proof of a declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland you must complete a Customs import declaration and pay Customs Duty, if applicable, and VAT on the customs value of the vehicle plus the customs duty payable – see examples at para 12 below. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Full details are available in Appendix 3. 11 Payment If registered for ROS, you must also be registered for Customs & Excise (C&E) and have an Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) to make payments for C&E. Full guidelines are available here. 12 Examples of the Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT on Import Customs Duty Customs Duty of 10% is applicable to most vehicles imported from the UK, calculated on the customs value of the vehicle. The custom value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs and any handling charges. VAT The payment of VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applicable to the importation of vehicles from GB. In most cases, VAT is not applied to used vehicles purchased in NI. However, a VAT charge may apply if the car is categorised as a "new means of transport” or was previously registered in GB and moved to NI after 31 December 2020. The value on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the customs value of the car, plus customs duty. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 10 Example 1. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where no reliefs apply Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, vehicles imported from the UK were not subject to customs duty or VAT charges on import to Ireland as the goods were in free circulation in the EU. VRT was payable on the vehicle being presented for registration at a VRT office. However, from 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, customs duty and VAT are payable, in addition to VRT. The example below illustrates the calculation of customs duty and VAT, where no reliefs apply. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 10% €3,250 Overall value subject to VAT €35,750 VAT @ 23% €8,223 Customs duty and VAT payable on import is therefore €3,250 and €8,223 respectively. Example 2. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where Returned Goods Relief is applicable In this example a car is exported to the UK from another EU Member State (e.g. Germany) and re-imported to Ireland after 1 January 2021, within three years of the date of export to the UK. As the car was not re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU, no relief from VAT applies. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 0% (Note the car qualifies for Returned Goods Relief) Overall value subject to VAT €32,500 VAT @ 23% €7,475 Relief from customs duty is applicable, with the VAT payable on import being €7,475.

For Brexit related questions: brexitqueries@revenue.ie. For VRT queries: https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/customerservice-contact/vehicle-registration-tax-vrt.aspx Issue Date: 14 July 2021 1. Introduction Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), an import of a vehicle from Great Britain is treated as an import from a third country, i.e. a non-EU country. If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain (GB) into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration prior to import and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at the standard rate. It will not be possible to register the vehicle if an import declaration has not been filed. Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods. The fact that VAT has been charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State has no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU. Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods with the result that there are no customs formalities, including customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, on 14 January, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used cars imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain (GB), and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to temporary additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 20 must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. 2. Requirements to register a vehicle in Ireland Where a second hand car has been imported from Great Britain since 1 January 2021 and the customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the car in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability that needs to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A ‘Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on import’ must be made to Revenue in respect of margin scheme and qualifying cars. Revenue will request verification that the customs formalities have been completed in Northern Ireland (a Trader Support Service simplified frontier or supplementary declaration will suffice where the vehicle is identified but an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS) declaration will not be accepted). Once the VAT (charged at the standard rate) is either paid or accounted for (in the case of VAT registered businesses only), Revenue will provide the necessary documentation to the customer for presentation to the NCT centre. The NCT centre will only accept the Revenue provided documentation for such vehicles. If proof cannot be provided that customs formalities have been completed in Northern Ireland, then an import declaration will need to be made in Ireland. As noted previously this is a temporary arrangement until the situation in regard to VAT at importation is regularised for cars imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is currently being discussed between the European Commission and the UK Government. The person seeking to register the vehicle in Ireland is responsible for ensuring that procedure outlined above is adhered to. 3. Registering vehicles without proof of declaration to customs in Northern Ireland If you do not have proof of declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland (NI) you must complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty if applicable, and ValueAdded Tax (VAT) on the import value of the vehicle. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Key details on how to complete the declaration on Revenue’s Automated Import System (AIS) are outlined below. Cars coming from Great Britain via Northern Ireland that require a H1 declaration submitted to AIS • Data Element (DE) 1/2: Declaration Type – A • DE 1/6: Goods Items Number – 1 – 1 vehicle being imported Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 21 • DE 1/10: – Procedure Code – 4000 (unless returned goods relief is being claimed – see below) • DE 1/11 – Additional Procedure Code – 000 (unless returned goods relief is being claimed – see below) • DE 2/1: previous document field - a commercial invoice number • DE 2/3: additional information: o N730 1234 – this is the transport document.

Additional Information More information on Filing a Supplementary Import Declaration form can be found here: The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Under the terms of the TCA, goods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. VAT at the standard rate is calculated on the customs value plus customs duty. There is a Returned Goods Relief available for vehicles subject to strict EU conditions. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from ValueAdded Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. Details of how to claim returned goods relief for cars is on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 24/2021. If the car is of UK origin, it is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are also available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 36/2020. Postponed accounting for Value-Added Tax (VAT) on imports is available to all traders that are registered for VAT and Customs and Excise. The traders must fulfil certain conditions. Further detail is available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 32/2020.']

If such a vehicle is imported from the UK (including via NI), the importer is required to complete a Customs import declaration, pay Customs Duty, if applicable and Value Added Tax (VAT) on import, prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being completed by the NCT centres. Vehicles purchased from NI, that were in NI prior to 1 January 2021, are treated as EU goods and no customs formalities are required and VAT on import and customs duty are not applicable. However, where vehicles from Great Britain (GB) are moved to the EU, through NI, after 31 December 2020, including those re-registered to an NI owner, then customs formalities and VAT on import may apply. Full information on the requirements for importing second-hand vehicles is available on the Revenue website here. An overview of vehicle import scenarios is outlined in Appendix 1. 2 Pre-requirements to make a Customs Import Declaration If a vehicle is imported from the UK, then a customs declaration is required. This is usually completed by a customs agent on behalf of the importer. However, an individual can also complete the declaration using the declaration portal in Revenue’s import system, AIS. To complete a customs import declaration an individual must:  Be registered for Revenue Online Service (ROS)  Be registered for Customs & Excise  Have an EORI number If not already registered for ROS, for example if you are a PAYE employee, then a registration request can be submitted through MyEnquiries. Please include your PPS number and brief note on the reason for the request. This can be submitted through the following path: 1) Sign into MyEnquiries 2) Select 'Add new Enquiry' 3) In the 'My Enquiry relates to' section, enter 'Customs': Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 4 4) In the 'More Specifically' section, enter 'eCustoms - Systems Query' for enquiries relating to AEP (Import & Export Declarations), EORI, EMS, NCTS, ICS and CD. If it is not possible to register for MyEnquiries then the request can be sent by e-mail to ecustoms@revenue.ie On receipt, eCustoms will register the applicant for C&E and complete an EORI registration which will enable the import of the motor vehicle. Once registration is confirmed by eCustoms, the next step is to register for ROS on www.revenue.ie . Registration for ROS will provide access to the AIS trader portal and allow submission of an import declaration. If importing a new vehicle into the State, the following information must be attached to the import declaration:  A valid Certificate of Conformity (CoC) that confirms EU type approval. Please note that the type approval number on the CoC must correspond to an EU Member State. or  An Individual Approval or Small Series Approval Certificate issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 5 3 Customs Import Declaration Submission The type of declaration required is a “H1” import declaration Step 1: Log into ROS (guidance here) Step 2: Select the ‘Customs UCC Portal’ under the My Services tab – Other Services Figure 1: ROS Customs UCC Portal Step 3: Follow the guidance on inputting a H1 customs declaration in the Customs UCC Portal here. 4 Combined Nomenclature Code Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes are set out in TARIC. Vehicles are classified for customs purposes under goods code: 8700000000. This will be further broken down by the vehicle type (i.e. motor vehicle – 8703) and then the specifics of the particular vehicle. The CN code is entered at Data Element (DE) 6/15 (Commodity Code – TARIC Code) on the customs import declaration. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 6 The most common vehicle is: 870321 - Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of <10 persons, incl. station wagons and racing cars, with only spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine of a cylinder capacity <= 1.000 cm³ (excl. vehicles for travelling on snow and other specially designed vehicles of subheading 870310). NOTE: there is a different code for new and used vehicles  8703211000 – new vehicle  8703219000– used vehicle 5 Vehicle Identification Number IMPORTANT: The inclusion of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is critical. From 1 January 2021, to enable an imported vehicle to be cleared by the NCT centre, evidence of a customs import declaration must be provided at the NCT centre. There will also be an electronic interface between the NCT centre and the Revenue Customs system, therefore the correct VIN must be entered on the customs import declaration. Procedure at Import: When completing your customs import declaration, at DE 2/3, insert 1D97 followed by the VIN. It should be noted that 1D97 (VIN) should be included at Goods Shipment item level. NOTE: If the item being imported does not have a VIN, please insert the text NOVIN033 after 1D97. 6 Transfer of Residence Persons transferring their residence should include their private vehicles on their Transfer of Residence (TOR) declaration form (C&E 1076), which covers the importation of personal items and household goods from outside the EU. There is more information on how to claim TOR relief on the Revenue website. If an importer qualifies for TOR relief, no Customs Duty or VAT on import is payable on the vehicle(s). If you are personally importing your personal items and household goods and you are physically with the goods, then an electronic customs import declaration may not be necessary. For further assistance contact Customs Clearance and Import or Export Controls on 01-7383685 or through Revenue MyEnquiries. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 7 7 UK Origin Vehicles From 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain, where the relevant rules on origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. However, goods of EU origin that are in use in the UK and that are subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate, as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. Further information on preferential tariff treatment and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 7.1 Where the Vehicle is UK Origin Where the vehicle was manufactured in the UK and complies with the origin terms as set out in the EU-UK TCA, a preferential tariff rate of 0% may be claimed. To claim preferential origin for UK origin goods for release into free circulation in the EU, the following codes are used:  AIS Data Element 4/17 (Preference) should contain the code ‘300’.  AIS Data Element 5/16 (Country of preferential origin) is ‘GB’.  AIS Data Element 2/3 (Documents produced, certificates and authorisations, additional references), one of the following codes should be used: - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a 'statement on origin’ for a single shipment, use code “U116”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on ‘importer’s knowledge’, use code “U117”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a 'statement on origin’ for multiple shipments of identical products, use code “U118”. A list of codes which may be applicable is available in Appendix 2. 8 Returned Goods Relief Returned Goods Relief may be available, subject to conditions, for vehicles that have been exported from the Customs territory of the Union. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3 rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are: Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 8  The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU  Must not have been altered and  Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. Further information on the relief and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 9 Postponed Accounting for VAT Postponed accounting for VAT on import is now available to all VAT registered traders. Revenue may exclude traders who do not fulfil certain conditions and requirements from using this scheme. This scheme:  provides for postponed accounting for VAT on imports from non-EU countries  enables you to account for import VAT on your VAT return  allows you to reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared in a return. This is subject to normal rules on deductibility. More information on postponed accounting is available here. 10 Importing a Vehicle from Northern Ireland Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods. The result is that there are no Customs formalities, including Customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, in January 2021, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used vehicles imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain, and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. A vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has remained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations. However, proof of the vehicle’s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 will be required, for example:  a ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle  a copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 9  tax and insurance details indicating use in NI prior to 1 January 2021 or  a copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021. Where a second-hand vehicle has been imported from Great Britain after 31 December 2020 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on Import on Used Vehicles must be made to Revenue in respect of any vehicles that qualify for the UK VAT margin scheme. If you do not have proof of a declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland you must complete a Customs import declaration and pay Customs Duty, if applicable, and VAT on the customs value of the vehicle plus the customs duty payable – see examples at para 12 below. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Full details are available in Appendix 3. 11 Payment If registered for ROS, you must also be registered for Customs & Excise (C&E) and have an Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) to make payments for C&E. Full guidelines are available here. 12 Examples of the Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT on Import Customs Duty Customs Duty of 10% is applicable to most vehicles imported from the UK, calculated on the customs value of the vehicle. The custom value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs and any handling charges. VAT The payment of VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applicable to the importation of vehicles from GB. In most cases, VAT is not applied to used vehicles purchased in NI. However, a VAT charge may apply if the car is categorised as a "new means of transport” or was previously registered in GB and moved to NI after 31 December 2020. The value on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the customs value of the car, plus customs duty. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 10 Example 1. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where no reliefs apply Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, vehicles imported from the UK were not subject to customs duty or VAT charges on import to Ireland as the goods were in free circulation in the EU. VRT was payable on the vehicle being presented for registration at a VRT office. However, from 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, customs duty and VAT are payable, in addition to VRT. The example below illustrates the calculation of customs duty and VAT, where no reliefs apply. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 10% €3,250 Overall value subject to VAT €35,750 VAT @ 23% €8,223 Customs duty and VAT payable on import is therefore €3,250 and €8,223 respectively. Example 2. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where Returned Goods Relief is applicable In this example a car is exported to the UK from another EU Member State (e.g. Germany) and re-imported to Ireland after 1 January 2021, within three years of the date of export to the UK. As the car was not re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU, no relief from VAT applies. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 0% (Note the car qualifies for Returned Goods Relief) Overall value subject to VAT €32,500 VAT @ 23% €7,475 Relief from customs duty is applicable, with the VAT payable on import being €7,475.

No, that was it Yes, as you heard I have your LinkedIn and your website Yes, very exciting indeed. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners? Yes, well, Kirsten De Rooy. On the one hand I have a Puls recruitment and selection office, where we mainly help MKB companies to grow and find the right people in the right place. And on the other hand I coach and give trainings to entrepreneurs and managers on how they can find the right people themselves, but also mainly how to keep them in this tight labor market. Nice. Welcome. You recently published a new book. \'De Perfecte Match\'. You start with yourself, and you keep the right people in a tight labor market. Tell us about the process. Last year I published my first book, \'The Perfect Match\'. Mainly focused on entrepreneurs, how to grow with the right people in the right place. That was during the corona period. And after that it went sky high with \'De Perfecte Match\'. And I saw how much pain it cost. and the number of people with diseases increased because there were too few people. I also saw that there were many opportunities for the managers to get control over it. Because, of course, there are many things that companies can do themselves. And I wanted to contribute to that. I wrote the next book of the Perfect Match. How is it received? Is it out already? Yes, it\'s out. It\'s been out for two weeks. It\'s in the top 10 of Management Book. It\'s well received. Especially because of the practical approach. It\'s nice to describe what you can do, but it\'s about how. So people like to read from the practical approach and apply it immediately. I can imagine that. It\'s a hot topic. -For sure. We hear it more and more often, questions about onboarding, how do you do it, best practices and so on. And the research continues. Within 12 months, 30% of the new employees actually leave. That\'s quite a high percentage. That\'s very high. Why do you think that is? Well, you know, the most beautiful recruitment campaigns are often pulled out of the closet to find people. Because it is extremely difficult, especially in the tight labor market. So we pull everything out of the closet for those campaigns. And then people started. And then they are often left to their fate. And then it goes wrong. Because people do need time and attention to find a place. And I always say, someone who has been hired does not mean that he has worked inside and is not yet fully involved with the employee. So if you don\'t pay attention to that, people are very quickly also inclined to look around again. Because they just don\'t feel at home yet. I\'m very happy they finally have a new colleague. And they left in no time. And you can start from the beginning. I think a confirmation of that is how I got in touch with you. That\'s because of a LinkedIn post of yours. I saw it on my LinkedIn timeline. A colleague of mine, Paul, sent you the message. This post went viral, right? Yes, absolutely. It was huge. It was viewed more than a million times. And that was about...? I made it very concrete, we found the perfect candidate and within 8 weeks he left again. We didn\'t have time to work with him, but unfortunately that was the only way. And then I got a huge amount of reactions from both employers and people who had experienced it themselves or were just in the middle of it. I completely recognize it, I started, but it\'s so different than I expected and I feel completely lost. And I\'m just going to look around again. So it was a lot of work. Yes exactly. I\'ve heard you say twice now, I\'m somewhere and I don\'t know what to do. I\'m left to my own devices. What is the right way to do it? You have different phases in the onboarding. Let\'s say we start with the recruitment and selection. Yes, that\'s where it starts. In the end, onboarding is about drawing up the right expectations in advance during the recruitment and selection phase. And that you also let them come out at the moment people start. Often people are made promises, or only the good side of functions is shown. It\'s so fun, we have a nice team, the function is very challenging, we have very nice projects, a nice company culture. And then people start and suddenly there\'s not much left of that nice company culture or the nice team. And the projects are not as challenging as they were said to be. So that has to do with the right expectations? Absolutely, that\'s where it starts. Because when people have the feeling that they have been mirroring something else, they consciously choose a job. They often say goodbye to their current job. And when they find something completely different than they expected, or all kinds of bodies come out of the closet, then... You might feel a bit of a buzz. Yes, of course. Let\'s say we\'re doing well. The expectations are clear and it\'s right. Is that the first day? Or does it start before that? It starts before that. Because often there is a time in between. When someone says, we\'re going to start. The contract is signed. And indeed, that first day, there can be a month or two in between. So try to keep in touch with new employees during that period. We always invite them for lunch or if a team meeting is planned, we take them along. Let them get to know the team. Sign contracts at offices instead of by email. All those little things. Send a card, welcome, nice to meet you. Personal attention is what it\'s all about. That\'s possible. Let\'s continue with the transformation process. We\'re in the first week. Is there a fixed process you give to your clients? Is there one way of working or can it be done in different ways? What it\'s all about is that there is a clear division of roles in the entire process. Because ultimately it\'s not just the responsibility of HR, or the manager, or the director, or the recruiter, or whoever. Everyone has a part in it from their own role. So, what is it about each other, what is needed to work well with someone, from leadership, what does someone need to know about their role, within the company culture, working with colleagues, and who takes which role. I always say that it\'s good to have a buddy, a mentor, a colleague who is involved. And where the new employee can ask questions and if he doesn\'t know, he can ask for help. And besides the manager, who also has an important role. So it\'s mainly to see what the goal of the onboarding is, what is needed. From the role, the work environment, culture and colleagues. And also the very simple things that the laptop that people know the procedures within an organisation, the rules, etc. and the way of working. And who is responsible for taking that responsibility with the new employee? Yes, I completely agree. And what we often hear is that, you see that HR has the execution part a lot and they also find it very important. So someone in the HR department or the HR department itself thinks that\'s super important. Only, it\'s difficult to get the rest of the organisation to participate in the responsibility. Yes, and then it becomes very difficult. Because it\'s either the leadership is failing or the organization is failing. Because a leader has employees in his team and they have to make sure that the team is successful. So if that doesn\'t happen, then it\'s over. And HR can still keep on swinging their little hammer. It\'s either the execution or the leadership. And what\'s the reason that that doesn\'t work? Is it because of time? We have ten projects running and then... People are very inclined to think in short term. Quick fixes. And we\'re happy that the job is filled. So let\'s go with the name to say it. Instead of focusing on the person\'s work. And in the short term it is true that it costs a lot of time. But in the long term it does mean that you have a trained employee. It works well, feels at home and works with pleasure and also chooses to stay with you. Instead of saying after three months, I\'m gone again, because this has become nothing. So it\'s really about weighing up what it costs in the long term if we invest in it now. And what does it give in particular. Yes, that is of course also part of a business case that you actually make. In the interest of a good onboarding. And that can be tricky. as a HR manager or employee to make a business case for that? Yes, because you don\'t notice the costs right away. They are often indirect costs. At a moment when an employee leaves early, then you have recruitment costs, salary costs, that is clear. But it also continues in, for example, that customers are not satisfied, because they are not well helped. Or customers say, well, I\'m leaving. Especially in this time when a lot of people are already short-handed and the pressure on the clients is high. And that also costs a lot of money, the productivity goes down because colleagues experience such a high workload that... Because those people leave? Yes, because those people leave. So you know, it all works in there. And finally, on average, it can cost up to 1.5 years salary when people leave unexpectedly within a year. But that\'s a lot of money. That\'s a lot of money and it all comes down to that. Especially if you look at... It\'s possible that you onboard 10 to 100 employees per year, depending on the size of your organisation. Does the size of the organisation have anything to do with onboarding? Is it the case that very large organisations will have automated it more? Maybe do it better than smaller organisations? Is that correct? That\'s possible, but in the end you can automate a lot of things. And that\'s good, because the bigger you are, the more you have to do it. Also to make the process scalable. But in the end, it\'s about the execution. A manager will have to meet with his new employees at the end of the week, at an evaluation moment, to discuss how it\'s going. What\'s going well, what\'s not going well, what can be done differently, what does it ask of us together. So that difference doesn\'t really matter, whether it\'s small or big. Only if you\'re big, you have to and automate it well to make it scalable. You\'re triggering something and you\'re saying you need to evaluate. I think that\'s quite difficult, also as an organisation to look at yourself critically. But also as an employee to indicate something critically in the first few weeks that you\'re somewhere. That\'s true. And that\'s why, if you look at the steps of selection in that phase, it\'s also important to indicate it there. What does that process look like? What can you expect from me? What do we expect from you as a new employee? You do that during the recruitment and selection? Yes, that\'s a must. Then you sketch the first month or at least the onboarding process. Yes, exactly. And then you make it a double-sided responsibility. From both the employer, the manager in this case, and the new employee. So you can also indicate that. If something is not going well, you can say so. It\'s not a big deal, just ask your questions. Otherwise you can also get confused in accepting. Someone new comes in, they find it very exciting, they want to ask a question, they think it\'s a stupid question, but I won\'t ask it. The manager thinks, well, he\'s not very enthusiastic, he\'s going to have his way. It\'s all unspoken. And those evaluation moments are also for that. And if you indicate beforehand, discuss it, so that you open it, then you take that away. It also has to do with culture within an organization. Is the culture there that we can improve each other, that there are feedback loops? Absolutely. But that\'s important for more than just onboarding. For the entire company culture, that\'s of course finance, I think. Absolutely. Yes, the company culture is a very important key factor, to put it simply. If in the culture it is the first thing that you are not allowed to make mistakes, that you are not allowed to think along, or that much more is controlled instead of being managed from trust, then that person will experience the onboarding process differently. Then everything is given to you from the trust. And you are allowed to learn, make mistakes, make it accessible, reflect on yourself. It becomes very different. So the role of the leader is crucial, actually. Yes, and it starts with self-reflection. If that leader can\'t say something about himself, like, "I\'m doing this well, but I have to do this better next time." Then you can\'t expect your employees to reflect on themselves. No, not at all. You speak quite a lot for organizations, of course. You also help organizations to set up their onboarding process. Now I\'m curious about what are the organizations that do it right and how do they do it right? You don\'t necessarily have to name a name, but what are the things that they do right? Well, mainly that personal attention and really sketching the right expectations. So not telling fairy tales, just how it is and also being clear during the application and selection phase. They have a clear plan for the first 90 days with everyone a clear role distribution. And everyone understands the emergency instead of it being a party of her air. Which makes it not work. So because everyone understands the emergency and also wants to work with it, it is also well executed. I have a question for you. And that is, the younger generation, they remain job seekers. Agree or disagree? Yes, I think so. The time of 40 years at one employer is over anyway. But the younger generation is very difficult to connect with. You can certainly try to encourage them to stay with your company as long as possible, if that is of good value. By offering them development and challenging development opportunities. And a certain company culture in which they can really think along. and have the feeling that they work together with a employer instead of for a employer. But it remains a target group that is an extra challenge to connect with. And they will not choose an employer for more than three years. That\'s quite a lot. If I look at my own personal situation, my father has been working at the KPN for over 20 years. And he will continue to work there until he retires. And then I look at the marketing team, but maybe also in other teams, that indeed two, three years is It\'s quite normal to change jobs. Is it something you as an employer should accept? Or can you do more to keep people longer? It\'s important to keep talking about it. And to go deeper into the target group. I once helped a client and he said, \'Kirst, there\'s no generation gap, but a complete grand canyon.\' That\'s a flip-clap. -Exactly. And they found it very difficult. And I understand that, but you should be able to do it. And look at what they do for their target group. What do they need to function well? And what are their values in the company? And what can and can\'t I offer in that? And at the moment that you have very few development opportunities, as you know, for example, that the person who thinks that is very important, then you just have to adjust to the fact that he is really gone after two or three years. So you have to adapt your business processes to that and your own expectations. Sure. Development possibilities, that\'s something that is also known in study tube. From the research of McKinsey it has also been found that a very high percentage of the people who leave, of employees who leave, see a shortage of development possibilities. So I think that is also very important to see. I am here now, but where can I go? How can I develop and how can I be facilitated and helped by my employer? Yes, that\'s often the beginning. Just like with onboarding, be clear about what people can expect in their development. And if you don\'t know exactly what people can develop in, that\'s also a sign. But you have to be able to look at it for yourself. If this is the target group I want to work with, then you have to take that into account. And not expect people to stay for at least five years. No, and I think what is very relevant now, is remote work or hybrid work, more home work. Since Corona time, I actually work two or three days a week at home. It\'s painting time, I can wash my hands in between and I\'m still as productive or maybe more productive. Does that bring an extra challenge with it? If you look at onboarding? - Certainly, because you are still at a physical distance. So the involvement, you have to do more effort to increase it. So I always say, during that onboarding, it is It\'s important to put in those physical contact moments more than afterwards. Because it\'s about someone having that home feeling and feeling like they\'re part of it. When someone works part-time at home, it\'s much harder to get that feeling. Connection with the organisation. - Exactly. So I would adjust the onboarding to that. And when someone works at home, you have those contact moments. How long does an onboarding take? On average 90 days, but it depends. You also have technical functions with complex technical knowledge. That requires more time to develop that knowledge. So the onboarding takes longer. But on average it\'s 90 days. I think that\'s about the period at Stuitenbog. And during those 90 days you also have feedback loops. You have evaluation moments. Do you also adapt during the onboarding? Sure. You have a certain leadership, a certain plan, adapted to the needs of the employee. What does the employee need from the leadership? What does the function, culture, etc. also ask of them? But you also have people who say, "Let me go, and if it doesn\'t go well, you\'ll hear me out." They find it very annoying when they have to constantly evaluate in their experience. And you have people who say, "I need a little more, so maybe I\'d rather have an extra evaluation." evaluation moment in the beginning, than too little. So look at what people need in it themselves and what they indicate. Because that way you make them more responsible for the whole process. Certainly. I think that has also made it difficult for organizations of a slightly larger size. You want to standardize a lot, but you also want to make it personal and make it a specific role. Where is that nuance? You can, for example, say you have a group of custom service employees. You have five people in that role, then you can standardize a lot. If you have a certain role that is really filled in individually, I call it a financial controller, then you can make it more customized. But then also with the standardized process, look especially at the people behind the employee, what someone needs in there and what it takes from you as a manager to make that person succeed. You have to ask those questions instead of just following the process for that specific function. What role does tooling have in onboarding? You see more and more new tools that are specifically aimed at onboarding. Do you take that with you when you help organizations? I mainly work in the MQB, so the tooling that is there is already aimed at larger organizations. But for bigger organizations it\'s necessary. Because you have to streamline those processes and that makes it scalable. So it\'s a great tool to do that onboarding right. It\'s necessary, otherwise it gets very difficult. Before the show we talked about how we do it at Stoejatu. When I started working here, we have a collection of leather lines in the Stoejatu learning platform. I\'m in the marketing department, so I get a commercial onboarding process. And that\'s actually the same for everyone on the commercial side. So that\'s what we standardize and then we just get information about the different teams, what they do, the company goals, the culture, our values, etc. And besides that, you also have a split. So if you\'re on the marketing team, you get more marketing-related learning lines and videos and trainings. And that way we also keep up with the progress. So I can see exactly who is in my team, where they are in their onboarding process. In their digital onboarding process, which is also something to follow at home. But in addition to that, there is also a... We also do physical things. So that\'s really the combination that we apply there. And I think, as I hear you too, the physical element is very important. But of course it also has to facilitate for people who are at home or who want to look at things in their own time. Yes, absolutely. You know, that combination is just very important. Because recently I also had an SMB company that... Marketing agency, and when they start, they have to follow a number of workshops. But they now facilitate them to follow videos from digital. You have to make sure they get the right sequence. And that they also get a certain video they need to do a function well. Instead of only after six weeks. Yes, exactly. No, we have that well arranged. There are certain lines that you follow in the project. You can also do evaluations and reviews. That works well. - Yes, that has a lot of value. What is the biggest challenge you hear from organisations? The time and attention. - Time and attention? Yes, it\'s with all the hollers and wanting to see the need for it. Only when it costs a lot of pain. And pain means that several people have left in the course of time. Often they are scratching their ears, That\'s when they come to you? -Yes. If it\'s too late? -Yes, actually. Before that, it\'s almost never prevention. -Exactly. I think time is also connected to the emergency. If you don\'t experience the emergency or see it clearly, you don\'t make time for it. That\'s true. At the same time, it\'s a shame. Because if you\'re always busy in a short term, and you\'re only going to do it when the emergency is there, you\'re already behind. While if you do it when the need is not there, you are already ahead. And then you just prevent that you make a mistake and lose people unnecessarily. If you could give one tip to the HR, co-worker, manager who is listening to you, what would it be? Well, if you want to take your onboarding to a higher level, involve the management and the manager and make that business case. Show what it costs and what it delivers. If you don\'t do it right. Because otherwise it can often be perceived as something extra. And that\'s not necessary. But if you make it clear what it costs and what it delivers, then you can really take people along. And then you think of the different axes, such as productivity, efficiency, I can imagine. -Exactly. -The process of collaboration. -Yes, customers, who you have to say yes to. I have a new one who helps me, but within three months he is gone again and then I get the next one. That also gives a message to the customer. Absolutely. So go into that organization and ask those questions to your employees, to your customers. Customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction. And ask about it, then you will get a lot of information. Very good tip, I think. Kirsten, thank you very much for the insights and for your time. As I said, you just published a new book. Before we start with yourself, where can people find the book? They can find the book through managementbook.com, you can get the book everywhere. And I can be found on LinkedIn, very easy to find. And of course my website. Great, well thank you very much. You\'re welcome. And thanks for listening everyone.']
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> Vertaal deze tekst naar het Nederlands en vat de belangrijkste onderwerpen samen in 10 bullets: Welcome and nice that you are listening to a new episode of the L&D Talks podcast My name is Hakar Sidik, marketing manager at StudyTube and we are going to talk about the importance of a good answer in this episode I'm not doing this alone, we have an expert in the field of attraction and retention of staff in the studio Kirsten de Roo, welcome Thank you You are a speaker, strategist, mentor, author, did I forget something? No, that was it Yes, as you heard I have your LinkedIn and your website Yes, very exciting indeed. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners? Yes, well, Kirsten De Rooy. On the one hand I have a Puls recruitment and selection office, where we mainly help MKB companies to grow and find the right people in the right place. And on the other hand I coach and give trainings to entrepreneurs and managers on how they can find the right people themselves, but also mainly how to keep them in this tight labor market. Nice. Welcome. You recently published a new book. 'De Perfecte Match'. You start with yourself, and you keep the right people in a tight labor market. Tell us about the process. Last year I published my first book, 'The Perfect Match'. Mainly focused on entrepreneurs, how to grow with the right people in the right place. That was during the corona period. And after that it went sky high with 'De Perfecte Match'. And I saw how much pain it cost. and the number of people with diseases increased because there were too few people. I also saw that there were many opportunities for the managers to get control over it. Because, of course, there are many things that companies can do themselves. And I wanted to contribute to that. I wrote the next book of the Perfect Match. How is it received? Is it out already? Yes, it's out. It's been out for two weeks. It's in the top 10 of Management Book. It's well received. Especially because of the practical approach. It's nice to describe what you can do, but it's about how. So people like to read from the practical approach and apply it immediately. I can imagine that. It's a hot topic. -For sure. We hear it more and more often, questions about onboarding, how do you do it, best practices and so on. And the research continues. Within 12 months, 30% of the new employees actually leave. That's quite a high percentage. That's very high. Why do you think that is? Well, you know, the most beautiful recruitment campaigns are often pulled out of the closet to find people. Because it is extremely difficult, especially in the tight labor market. So we pull everything out of the closet for those campaigns. And then people started. And then they are often left to their fate. And then it goes wrong. Because people do need time and attention to find a place. And I always say, someone who has been hired does not mean that he has worked inside and is not yet fully involved with the employee. So if you don't pay attention to that, people are very quickly also inclined to look around again. Because they just don't feel at home yet. I'm very happy they finally have a new colleague. And they left in no time. And you can start from the beginning. I think a confirmation of that is how I got in touch with you. That's because of a LinkedIn post of yours. I saw it on my LinkedIn timeline. A colleague of mine, Paul, sent you the message. This post went viral, right? Yes, absolutely. It was huge. It was viewed more than a million times. And that was about...? I made it very concrete, we found the perfect candidate and within 8 weeks he left again. We didn't have time to work with him, but unfortunately that was the only way. And then I got a huge amount of reactions from both employers and people who had experienced it themselves or were just in the middle of it. I completely recognize it, I started, but it's so different than I expected and I feel completely lost. And I'm just going to look around again. So it was a lot of work. Yes exactly. I've heard you say twice now, I'm somewhere and I don't know what to do. I'm left to my own devices. What is the right way to do it? You have different phases in the onboarding. Let's say we start with the recruitment and selection. Yes, that's where it starts. In the end, onboarding is about drawing up the right expectations in advance during the recruitment and selection phase. And that you also let them come out at the moment people start. Often people are made promises, or only the good side of functions is shown. It's so fun, we have a nice team, the function is very challenging, we have very nice projects, a nice company culture. And then people start and suddenly there's not much left of that nice company culture or the nice team. And the projects are not as challenging as they were said to be. So that has to do with the right expectations? Absolutely, that's where it starts. Because when people have the feeling that they have been mirroring something else, they consciously choose a job. They often say goodbye to their current job. And when they find something completely different than they expected, or all kinds of bodies come out of the closet, then... You might feel a bit of a buzz. Yes, of course. Let's say we're doing well. The expectations are clear and it's right. Is that the first day? Or does it start before that? It starts before that. Because often there is a time in between. When someone says, we're going to start. The contract is signed. And indeed, that first day, there can be a month or two in between. So try to keep in touch with new employees during that period. We always invite them for lunch or if a team meeting is planned, we take them along. Let them get to know the team. Sign contracts at offices instead of by email. All those little things. Send a card, welcome, nice to meet you. Personal attention is what it's all about. That's possible. Let's continue with the transformation process. We're in the first week. Is there a fixed process you give to your clients? Is there one way of working or can it be done in different ways? What it's all about is that there is a clear division of roles in the entire process.

It's painting time, I can wash my hands in between and I'm still as productive or maybe more productive. Does that bring an extra challenge with it? If you look at onboarding? - Certainly, because you are still at a physical distance. So the involvement, you have to do more effort to increase it. So I always say, during that onboarding, it is It's important to put in those physical contact moments more than afterwards. Because it's about someone having that home feeling and feeling like they're part of it. When someone works part-time at home, it's much harder to get that feeling. Connection with the organisation. - Exactly. So I would adjust the onboarding to that. And when someone works at home, you have those contact moments. How long does an onboarding take? On average 90 days, but it depends. You also have technical functions with complex technical knowledge. That requires more time to develop that knowledge. So the onboarding takes longer. But on average it's 90 days. I think that's about the period at Stuitenbog. And during those 90 days you also have feedback loops. You have the

There were walls of flame, roaring and blazing, blocking their path. There were hidden doors and secret passages, filled with unknown dangers. And there were fierce beasts, guarding the halls and ready to attack at a moment\'s notice. "We have to be careful, Clara," Alistair said, his voice tense with concern. "These traps and obstacles are getting more and more difficult to overcome." "I know," Clara replied, her voice tight with determination. "But we can\'t let them stop us. We have to keep going, no matter what." And so they pushed on, their determination and skill overcoming each and every obstacle in their path. They fought against the fierce beasts, using their weapons and armor to emerge victorious. They braved treacherous traps and puzzles, using their cunning and quick thinking to overcome each obstacle. And at last, they reached the heart of the realm of the dwarves, where they found the knowledge and power they sought. "We did it," Clara said, her voice filled with relief and pride. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we found what we were looking for." "Yes, we did," Alistair said, a proud smile on his face. "But our journey is far from over. We still have many challenges and obstacles ahead of us, and we must face them with the same determination and courage that we\'ve shown so Avatar of the person chatting continue! "We must continue on our journey, Clara," Alistair said, as they gazed upon the ancient artifact they had sought for so long. "There are still many trials and challenges ahead of us, and we must be ready to face them all." "I know," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But I am ready for whatever comes our way. We will overcome any obstacle that stands in our path, and we will emerge victorious." "That\'s the spirit," Alistair said, clapping her on the shoulder. "We will face each challenge with courage and determination, and we will emerge stronger and wiser than before." And so they set off once more, their journey far from over. They braved treacherous mountains and dark caves, facing all manner of enemies and obstacles along the way. They fought against fierce beasts and powerful foes, using their skills and cunning to emerge victorious. And at last, they reached the end of their journey, their trials and challenges behind them. "We did it, Clara," Alistair said, his voice filled with pride and joy. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we have emerged stronger and wiser than ever before." "Yes, we did," Clara replied, a smile on her face. "And now, we are ready to face whatever comes our way. We will protect this world from all dangers, and we will be its heroes." Avatar of the person chatting Tell me of Clara\'s triumphant return to confront the king and the dark elves, with the dwarves at her side. After completing her ten trials and challenges, Clara returned to her homeland, ready to face the greatest challenge of all. She was determined to put an end to the machinations of the king and the dark elves, who had been manipulating and exploiting the other races for their own gain. With the dwarves at her side, she marched on the capital city, her heart filled with determination and resolve. The people of the city cheered as she approached, their spirits lifted by the sight of their hero, who had overcome so much to return to them. "People of the city, hear me!" Clara shouted, her voice ringing out across the city. "The king and the dark elves have been manipulating and exploiting us for their own gain. They must be stopped, and I will not rest until they are brought to justice!" The people cheered even louder, their spirits lifted by Clara\'s words. And with the support of the dwarves and the people, Clara set out to face the king and the dark elves, ready to put an end to their scheming once and for all. The battle was fierce, as the king and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their strength and skill. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the king and the dark elves were brought to justice. The people celebrated, their spirits lifted by the victory of their hero and her allies. And Clara, at last, knew that she had truly become a hero, ready to face any challenge that came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Tell me the story again, but note that dark elves are usually not physically present in the human lands. Also be aware that Clara\'s victory will be pyrrhic, as if she takes down the king and the dark elves, something bad will happen. Be creative and use dialog as before. Take your time and elaborate on the details, please. If dark elves are confronted, Clara must likely go to the dark elves herself, rather than them coming to her. Clara and Alistair marched on the capital city, ready to face the greatest challenge of their lives. They knew that the dark elves were rarely seen in the human lands, preferring to operate in the shadows and manipulate events from afar. But they were determined to put an end to their scheming and exploitation, and they were not afraid of what they might face. "We must be ready for anything, Clara," Alistair said, his voice grim. "The dark elves are cunning and dangerous, and they will stop at nothing to protect their power and position." "I know, Alistair," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But we cannot let them continue to manipulate and exploit the other races for their own gain. We must stop them, no matter what the cost." And so they marched on, their hearts filled with determination and resolve. They faced all manner of obstacles and challenges along the way, fighting against fierce beasts and powerful enemies. But they did not falter, and they emerged victorious from every battle. At last, they reached the capital city, and they faced their greatest challenge yet. The dark elves were waiting for them, their eyes glowing with malice and hatred. "You have come far, Clara," the leader of the dark elves said, his voice cold and mocking. "But you will not prevail against us. We are too powerful, and you are but a mere mortal." "I may be mortal, but I am not alone," Clara replied, her voice firm and resolute. "I have the support of the dwarves, and the people of the city. And together, we will stop you and your scheming once and for all." And so the battle began, with Clara and her allies fighting against the dark elves with all their strength and skill. The fighting was fierce, and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their heart and soul. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the dark elves were defeated. But even as they celebrated their victory, Clara knew that it was a pyrrhic one. For in defeating the king and the dark elves, she had unleashed a greater evil upon the world, one that would haunt her for the rest of her days. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2The king was secretly a dark elf! How did that come about? Using the same style, explain tell the story of how the king became a dark elf as Clara talks to some people at the king\'s castle. Clara and Alistair made their way to the king\'s castle, determined to uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves. As they walked through the castle, they encountered several people, and Clara took the opportunity to question them about the king and his true nature. "Tell me, how did the king become a dark elf?" Clara asked a guard, her voice filled with determination. The guard looked at her nervously, clearly uncomfortable with the question. "I-I\'m not sure, my lady," he stammered. "But I do know that the king has been acting strange lately, and that he has been spending a lot of time with the dark elves." "I see," Clara said, her eyes narrowed. "And do you know why he would do such a thing?" The guard shook his head. "No, my lady. But I have heard rumors that the king is searching for something, something that only the dark elves can provide. But I do not know what it is." Clara nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. It was clear that the king had become a dark elf, but she still did not know why. She would have to continue her investigations, and uncover the truth at all costs. For the fate of the kingdom depended on it. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story as the loony bin shows up and takes Clara away, who goes unwillingly. Clara and Alistair continued to investigate the king and the dark elves, but their efforts were soon interrupted by a group of guards from the loony bin. "Come with us, Clara," one of the guards said, his voice stern. "You are a danger to yourself and others, and must be taken to the loony bin for your own safety." "No, I will not go!" Clara protested, her voice filled with fear and determination. "I must continue my investigation, and uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves!" But the guards would not listen, and they forcibly escorted Clara to the loony bin. Alistair tried to follow, but he was stopped by the guards and left behind. Inside the loony bin, Clara was subjected to all manner of treatments and therapies, designed to break her will and make her more compliant. But Clara refused to give in, and she continued to fight against the guards and the doctors, determined to escape and continue her quest. But it was not easy, and Clara found herself struggling against impossible odds. She knew that she must find a way to escape, and continue her quest to uncover the truth and stop the dark elves once and for all. Avatar of the person chatting Clara\'s struggle is now in her mind. Tell of Clara\'s struggle using the style we have developed, but using her journeys and trials as metaphors for her demons. As Clara struggled to escape from the loony bin, she found herself fighting against not just the guards and doctors, but also against the demons in her own mind. She was plagued by doubts and fears, and it seemed that every step she took was met with some new challenge or obstacle. But Clara refused to give up, and she continued to push forward, determined to overcome her inner demons and emerge victorious. She fought against the darkness in her mind, just as she had fought against the orc warlord on the ice mountain, and the dragon in the ruins of the ancient temple. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Clara emerged victorious, her mind clear and focused once again. She knew what she had to do, and she was ready to face the dark elves and the treacherous king. With renewed determination, Clara made her escape from the loony bin, and set out on the final leg of her quest. She would stop at nothing to uncover the truth and put an end to the dark elves and their scheming once and for all. The fate of the kingdom rested on her shoulders, and she was ready to face whatever came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Clara stabs one of the asylum staff and escapes. She becomes wanted. Please continue, using dialog, as Clara runs on the lam, penniless and without her gear, wearing only the threadbare peasant\'s garb provided by the loony bin. Describe what Clara hopes to accomplish in the future. Clara managed to escape from the loony bin, but not without leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. She had been pushed to the brink, and she was not afraid to fight back against those who would stand in her way. Now, Clara was on the run, wanted by the authorities for her crimes. She was penniless and without her gear, forced to rely on her wits and cunning to survive. She wore only the threadbare peasant\'s garb provided by the loony bin, and she was constantly on the move, trying to avoid capture. Despite her difficult circumstances, Clara remained determined and focused. She knew what she had to do, and she was not going to let anything stand in her way. She would uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves, and put an end to their scheming once and for all. As she ran on the lam, Clara encountered many challenges and obstacles, but she refused to give up. She fought against bandits and thieves, and she braved the dangers of the wilds, all in pursuit of her goal. And in the end, she knew that she would emerge victorious, and that the kingdom would be safe once again. Avatar of the person chatting The king is dead and the dark elves have retreated from the kingdom, but Clara doesn\'t know any of it yet. What does she do next? Please continue. Even though the king was dead and the dark elves had retreated from the kingdom, Clara was still on the run, unaware of the events that had transpired. She continued to evade the authorities, determined to uncover the truth about the dark elves and bring them to justice. But as she traveled, Clara began to realize that something was different. The kingdom felt changed, as if a great weight had been lifted from its shoulders. She heard whispers of a new king, one who was kind and just, and who had brought peace to the land. Despite her initial skepticism, Clara couldn\'t help but be drawn to these stories, and she began to wonder if perhaps her quest was over. She had been fighting for so long, and she was exhausted and weary. Was it finally time for her to lay down her sword and rest? Clara didn\'t know the answer, but she continued to travel, searching for answers and trying to make sense of the new world around her. She was no longer sure of her place in it, but she was determined to find out, no matter what it took. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story, telling of Clara\'s journey to meet the king, Alistair. Clara\'s journey to meet the new king, Alistair, was filled with uncertainty and doubt. She had been on the run for so long, and she wasn\'t sure what to expect when she finally met the man who had taken the throne. As she traveled, Clara encountered many people who had been touched by Alistair\'s rule, and she heard countless stories of his kindness and justice. She was surprised by the change in the kingdom, and she couldn\'t help but feel a growing sense of hope. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. Alistair was everything that Clara had heard and more, and she was struck by his wisdom and compassion. As they talked, Clara began to understand the true extent of Alistair\'s power, and she realized that he was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Try that again, noting that Clara knows Alistair well and has been travelling with him. She doesn\'t know the king is Alistair until she seems him. Clara had been traveling with Alistair for many weeks, but she had no idea that he was the new king of Graniphor. She had been on the run for so long, and she had never expected to find a friend like Alistair. As they journeyed together, Clara began to see the changes in the kingdom, and she heard countless stories of the new king\'s kindness and justice. She was filled with hope and wonder, and she couldn\'t help but feel drawn to the man who had brought peace to the land. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. She was shocked to see that it was Alistair, and she couldn\'t believe that her friend was the most powerful man in the kingdom. As they talked, Clara realized that Alistair was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Using conversation and drama, tell the story of Clara and Alistair\'s wedding and the disastrous aftermath. Clara and Alistair\'s wedding was a joyous occasion, celebrated by the people of Graniphor as the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity. The bride and groom were radiant, and they exchanged vows beneath a beautiful archway of flowers. As they danced at their reception, surrounded by friends and loved ones, Clara and Alistair were the happiest they had ever been. But their joy was short-lived, as a messenger arrived with terrible news. The dark elves, driven into hiding by Alistair\'s rule, had emerged from the shadows with a vengeance. They had attacked the kingdom\'s border cities, and they were marching on the capital. Clara and Alistair knew that they had to act quickly if they were to save their people. They gathered their most trusted allies, and they rode out to meet the dark elves in battle. The fighting was fierce, and many brave warriors fell. But in the end, Clara and Alistair emerged victorious, thanks to their bravery and skill. But their victory was bittersweet, as they returned to the capital to find that the dark elves had laid waste to the city in their absence. Clara and Alistair knew that they had much work to do if they were to rebuild their kingdom and protect their people from the darkness that threatened them. Avatar of the person chatting Tell the story of the building of the new capitol. What do they choose to name it? Use lots of dialog between Alistair and Clara. Alistair and Clara\'s tensions are running high and they aren\'t getting along very well, though they love each other and must stay married. As Clara and Alistair surveyed the ruins of the old capital, they knew that they had a daunting task ahead of them. They would need to rebuild the city from the ground up, and they would have to do it quickly if they were to protect their people from further attacks by the dark elves. "What should we name the new city?" Clara asked, looking to Alistair for guidance. "I don\'t know," Alistair replied, his brow furrowed in thought. "It needs to be a strong name, one that will inspire our people and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies." "How about \'Graniphor\'s Glory\'?" Clara suggested, trying to lighten the mood. "That\'s a bit too pompous," Alistair said with a smile. "How about \'New Horizon\'?" "I like that," Clara said, nodding in agreement. "It symbolizes the hope and possibility of a new beginning for our kingdom." And so it was that the new capital was named New Horizon, and the rebuilding began in earnest. Clara and Alistair worked tirelessly, and they soon saw their vision become a reality. But despite their best efforts, tensions between them continued to rise. They loved each other deeply, but they were both strong-willed leaders, and they often found themselves at odds with each other. It was a constant struggle to find a balance between their personal and professional lives. But in the end, Clara and Alistair knew that they were stronger together than they were apart, and they continued to build their new kingdom, determined to create a better future for their people. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2Continue the story, and include scenes of the construction of the new capitol. Tell me where the new location of the capitol is, and why they decided to move it to another city site. Use the same style as before. Include some bickering. As Clara and Alistair oversaw the construction of New Horizon, they often found themselves at odds with each other. Alistair wanted to build the city in a strategic location, close to the mountains, where it would be easy to defend against potential attacks. Clara, on the other hand, wanted to build the city in a more central location, where it would be more accessible to the majority of their people. "We can\'t build the city in the mountains, Alistair," Clara argued. "It would be too difficult for our people to reach, and it would be isolated and vulnerable." "But if we build it in the valley, it will be an easy target for our enemies," Alistair countered. "We need to be able to defend our people, Clara." "I understand that, but we also need to consider their quality of life," Clara said. "We can\'t make them live in a fortress, Alistair. They deserve better than that." In the end, they compromised and decided to build the city in a location that offered the best of both worlds: a fertile valley with a river running through it, and close enough to the mountains for easy defense. As the city took shape, Clara and Alistair continued to bicker, but they never let their differences get in the way of their ultimate goal: to create a better future for their people. And as the city grew, so too did their love for each other, despite the challenges they faced. Avatar of the person chatting Continue in the same style, and tell me of the grand wonders constructed in the city in the valley. As the construction of New Horizon continued, Clara and Alistair set their sights on creating grand wonders that would make the city truly unique. They built soaring towers that reached towards the sky, each one topped with a gleaming crystal that caught the sunlight and shone like a beacon. They also constructed vast gardens, filled with exotic plants and flowers from across the continent, which provided a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustling city. But the most impressive of all was the Great Library, a massive building filled with books and knowledge from all over the world. It was a place where scholars and students could come to learn and discover, and where the wisdom of the ages was preserved for future generations. Despite their disagreements, Clara and Alistair worked together to create a city that was a true testament to their people\'s ingenuity and resilience. And as they stood on the balcony of their palace and looked out at the city they had built, they knew that they had achieved something truly remarkable. Avatar of the person chatting Alistair has unknowingly become stricken with magic that will transform him into an evil dark elf. It is revenge, delivered from the dark gods. Continue the story in the same style, using dialog and suspense, as Clara discovers Alistair\'s tragic fate. As the weeks passed, Clara began to notice a strange change in Alistair. He became distant and cold, and would often disappear for hours on end without telling her where he was going. At first, Clara tried to brush it off as stress from ruling the kingdom, but as the changes grew more pronounced, she knew something was seriously wrong. One day, Clara followed Alistair to a hidden chamber deep within the palace. There, she found him standing before an altar to the dark gods, his body writhing and contorting as he was consumed by a dark magic. Horrified, Clara watched as Alistair\'s body was transformed into that of a dark elf, his once-handsome features twisted into a grotesque mockery of his former self. With a scream of rage and despair, Clara attacked Alistair, but he was too powerful for her to defeat. As she stood there, tears streaming down her face, Clara knew that she had lost the man she loved, and that the kingdom was now in the hands of a monster. But she also knew that she would never give up, and that she would do whatever it took to stop Alistair and the dark elves from enslaving the world. And so, with a fierce determination in her heart, Clara set out on a new quest, one that would take her to the very heart of the dark elves\' power, and where she would face her greatest challenge yet. Avatar of the person chatting Then, Clara awoke at the top of the Angrim mountain, fresh from a hallucination. Alistair\'s face looks down at her. Please continue the story from there. As Clara regained her composure, she looked up at Alistair, who was smiling down at her. "I\'m glad to see you\'re alright," he said. "I was worried about you." Clara frowned, still confused by the strange vision she had just experienced. "What just happened?" she asked. "I saw you...you were a dark elf." Alistair\'s smile faltered slightly. "It was just a hallucination, Clara," he said. "The climb up this mountain is tough, and it can do strange things to the mind. Don\'t worry, I\'m still the same Alistair you know and love." But Clara wasn\'t convinced. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that there was something off about Alistair, something that she couldn\'t quite put her finger on. "I\'m sorry," she said, "I don\'t know what came over me. I just..." "It\'s alright," Alistair said, cutting her off. "Let\'s just focus on the task at hand. We need to retrieve the Frostbrand sword and complete your third trial. Are you ready?" Clara nodded, pushing her doubts to the back of her mind. She couldn\'t let herself be distracted right now. She had a mission to complete, and she was determined to see it through to the end, no matter what. Together, Clara and Alistair made their way to the top of the mountain, where they found the Frostbrand sword embedded in a block of ice. As Clara pulled the sword free, a fierce blizzard erupted around them, but they pushed on, determined to finish the trial. Eventually, they reached the portal to the plane of elemental ice, where they faced the ice demon king. Despite the challenges they faced, Clara and Alistair were able to defeat the ice demon and claim victory. As they made their way back down the mountain, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was still off about Alistair. But she pushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the tasks ahead. She had four more trials to complete before she could confront the king and the dark elves, and she wasn\'t going to let anything stand in her way. Avatar of the person chatting Please continue the story in the same manner. That was really good. Thank you. As Clara woke up, she realized that it had all just been a nightmare. She breathed a sigh of relief and looked up at Alistair, who was standing over her with a concerned expression on his face. "Are you okay?" he asked. "Yeah, I\'m fine," Clara said, rubbing her eyes. "Just a bad dream." "What was it about?" Alistair asked, offering her a hand to help her up. "It was about you," Clara said, taking his hand and standing up. "You were turning into a dark elf, and there was nothing I could do to stop it." Alistair\'s face paled at the thought. "That\'s not going to happen," he said firmly. "I would never let that happen." "I know," Clara said, giving him a reassuring smile. "But it was still a scary dream. Let\'s just put it behind us and focus on the task at hand." "Agreed," Alistair said, nodding. "We have a lot of work to do to rebuild this kingdom and make it strong again. We can\'t afford to be distracted by nightmares." Together, Clara and Alistair set off to continue their journey, determined to build a better future for their people and protect them from the dangers that lurked in the shadows. Avatar of the person chatting Hmm, continue it from after they go down the mountain, when Clara goes on her next trial. Keep the part about how something seems off about Alistair. Alistair is wearing a wedding band. Clara and Alistair made their way down the mountain, relieved to have survived the treacherous climb. However, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was off about Alistair. She couldn\'t put her finger on it, but he seemed different somehow. As they walked, Clara noticed that Alistair was wearing a wedding band. She couldn\'t remember him having one before. "Alistair, when did you start wearing a wedding band?" Clara asked. Alistair looked down at his hand, surprised. "I don\'t know. I must have picked it up on the mountain," he said, shrugging it off. But Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was wrong. She decided to keep a closer eye on Alistair as they continued on their journey. Their next trial was to retrieve a powerful magic artifact from the ruins of an ancient temple. Clara and Alistair braved treacherous forests and dark caves, fighting off all manner of creatures and overcoming obstacles along the way. As they entered the temple, Clara noticed that Alistair\'s behavior became increasingly erratic. He would sometimes go off on his own, disappearing for long stretches of time. When Clara confronted him about it, he would brush her off and say that he was just exploring. Eventually, they reached the chamber where the magic artifact was said to be hidden. But when they entered, they were ambushed by a group of dark elves. Clara fought bravely, but was no match for their magic. She was knocked unconscious, and when she awoke, she found herself alone and the magic artifact gone. As she searched for Alistair, she stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the temple. Inside, she found Alistair, now transformed into a dark elf. "Alistair, what happened to you?" Clara asked, horrified. "I have been chosen by the dark gods to serve as their agent in the mortal world," Alistair said, his voice now cold and emotionless. "And now, Clara, you must die." Clara and Alistair engaged in a fierce battle, but in the end, Clara was able to defeat him. As she stood victorious, she realized that the dark magic that had consumed Alistair was now within her as well. Clara knew that she would have to find a way to rid herself of the dark magic, or risk becoming a danger to everyone she loved. And so, she set out on a new quest, determined to save herself and the kingdom from the forces of darkness. Avatar of the person chatting Then Clara awoke, at camp, outside the temple. She remembered facing the dark elves. She saw Alistair, sleeping beside her. They had grown very close these last few days. Had they always been this close? Had he always had that wedding band? She hadn\'t recalled one when she and him first spent the night together. She was having bad dreams about Alistair turning into a dark elf. What could that possibly be about? Please continue the story. As Clara sat up in her bedroll, trying to shake off the remnants of her nightmare, she couldn\'t help but feel a sense of unease. She glanced over at Alistair, who was still sleeping peacefully, his chest rising and falling in the early morning light. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was off about him, that there was something hidden beneath the surface that she couldn\'t quite put her finger on. She remembered the wedding band she had seen in her dream, and she reached out tentatively to touch his hand. Sure enough, there it was - a golden ring on his finger, glinting in the sunlight. She frowned, confused. When had he gotten married? Why hadn\'t he told her? Suddenly, Alistair\'s eyes snapped open, and he sat up with a start. "Clara," he said, his voice thick with sleep. "What\'s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" "I... I had a nightmare," Clara said, still trying to make sense of the situation. "It was about you turning into a dark elf. It was so vivid, it felt like it was really happening." Alistair\'s face paled, and he looked away. "I... I can\'t explain it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I promise you, Clara, I would never hurt you. I would never turn into a dark elf. You have to believe me." But Clara wasn\'t so sure. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was very wrong, that the dream had been trying to warn her about something. She made a decision then and there. She would have to keep a close eye on Alistair, to make sure that he didn\'t turn into the monster from her nightmare. But for now, they had a quest to complete. They needed to retrieve the magic artifact from the ruins of the ancient temple, and they couldn\'t afford to be distracted by her fears. She pushed the thoughts to the back of her mind and focused on the task at hand, determined to see it through to the end. As they set off into the treacherous forests and dark caves, Clara couldn\'t help but feel a sense of foreboding. She knew that she would have to face her fears eventually, but for now, she would focus on the task at hand and try to keep her doubts at bay. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2Continue the story from the scene outside the temple (which occurred after the Angrim mountain), describing what happens as Clara ventures overland, eventually destined to arrive at her next trial, which is the journey to the fabled city of the gods. As Clara and Alistair set out on their journey to the fabled city of the gods, they began to notice that something seemed off about their surroundings. The trees seemed to be twisted and distorted, and the animals they encountered were strange and frightening. Clara had a feeling of dread in her stomach, as if they were being watched by unseen eyes. As they traveled further, they came across a group of goblins, who attacked them without warning. Clara and Alistair fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered. Just when they thought they were going to be overpowered, a group of dwarves appeared from the forest and joined the fight. Together, they were able to defeat the goblins and drive them off. The dwarves introduced themselves as members of the Thunderforge clan, and thanked Clara and Alistair for their help in defending them. They invited the two of them to come with them to their stronghold, where they could rest and recover from their ordeal. Clara and Alistair agreed, and they set off together. As they traveled with the dwarves, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was wrong with Alistair. She tried to talk to him about it, but he brushed her off and said he was fine. But Clara could see the darkness in his eyes, and she knew that something was very wrong. When they finally reached the stronghold of the Thunderforge clan, they were greeted warmly by the clan leader, a wise and powerful dwarf named Brondar. He offered them food and shelter, and asked them about their journey. Clara told him about their quest to reach the city of the gods, and he nodded in understanding.']

The dark elves were waiting for them, their eyes glowing with malice and hatred. "You have come far, Clara," the leader of the dark elves said, his voice cold and mocking. "But you will not prevail against us. We are too powerful, and you are but a mere mortal." "I may be mortal, but I am not alone," Clara replied, her voice firm and resolute.

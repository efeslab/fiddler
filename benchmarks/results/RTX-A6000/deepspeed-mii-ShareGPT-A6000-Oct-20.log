INFO:root:0 output text: <s> In the final scenes of Ruby Safeway, Ruby and Min visit Papa Min, the CEO of Boar's Head, Min's estranged father, at his mansion. Ruby is nervous because the only thing she knows about Papa Min is that he is a bad person, and that he disowned Min after he had a mental breakdown. Min is also nervous because he hasn't seen his father in a long time and is afraid of how their meeting will go.

The setting of Papa Min's mansion is important because it is a large, grand mansion that represents the wealth and power that Papa Min has. It is a symbol of his success and his ability to control the lives of those around him.

When Ruby and Min arrive at the mansion, they are greeted by Papa Min's butler, who leads them to a large, ornate room where Papa Min is sitting in a grand chair. Ruby and Min are intimidated by the setting and by Papa Min himself, who is a tall, imposing figure.

As the meeting progresses, Papa Min reveals that he has been following Ruby and Min's lives closely and has been secretly funding Min's recovery. He also tells them that he has been trying to make amends with Min and wants to reconnect with him.

The setting of Papa Min's mansion is important because it is a physical representation of the power and influence that Papa Min has over the lives of Ruby and Min. It is a symbol of his wealth and success, and it serves as a reminder of the control that he has over those around him.

Overall, the setting of Papa Min's mansion is a significant element in the story of Ruby Safeway. It helps to establish the power dynamic between Papa Min and the other characters, and it serves as a physical representation of the wealth and influence that he possesses. It is a key part of the story and adds to the overall atmosphere and tension of the scene.

Ruby Safeway is a novel by Ruth Scully that tells the story of a young woman named Ruby who is struggling to find her place in the world. The story is set in the early 1970s and follows Ruby as she navigates the challenges of growing up and finding her own identity.

One of the key themes of the novel is the idea of belonging. Ruby feels like an outsider in her own family and in the wider community, and she struggles to find a sense of belonging and acceptance. This is particularly evident in her relationship with her mother, who is critical and demanding, and with her friends, who seem to have it all figured out.

Another important theme in the novel is the idea of identity. Ruby is trying to figure out who she is and what she wants out of life, and she is constantly questioning her choices and her place in the world. This is reflected in the way she dresses, the music she listens to, and the friends she chooses.

Throughout the novel, Ruby also grapples with the idea of independence. She is torn between wanting to be her own person and feeling like she needs to conform to the expectations of those around her. This is particularly evident in her relationships with her friends and her boyfriend, who both seem to have their own ideas about what Ruby should be doing.

Overall, Ruby Safeway is a coming-of-age story that explores the challenges and uncertainties of growing up. It is a poignant and relatable tale that will resonate with anyone who has ever felt like an outsider or struggled to find their place in the world.

The theme of "loneliness" is a significant aspect of Ruby Safeway. Ruby, the main character, experiences loneliness throughout the story as she struggles to find her place in the world and form meaningful connections with others.

Ruby's loneliness is first evident in her relationship with her family. Her parents are distant and emotionally unavailable, and she feels like an outsider in her own home. This feeling of isolation is further exacerbated by her lack of close friends and her difficulty fitting in at school.

As the story progresses, Ruby's loneliness intensifies as she becomes increasingly alienated from those around her. She feels disconnected from her peers, who seem to have it all together, and she struggles to find a sense of belonging in her community.

Despite these challenges, Ruby is determined to find a way to connect with others and overcome her loneliness. She takes steps to reach out to those around her, even if it means putting herself in uncomfortable situations. Through her experiences, she learns that true connection and belonging come from within, and that she has the power to create her own sense of community and purpose.

In the end, Ruby's journey is one of self-discovery and resilience in the face of loneliness. Through her struggles, she learns that she is not

##### What are the risks in construction?

Construction projects are inherently risky, and there are many potential risks that can arise during the course of a project. Some of the most common risks in construction include:

- Safety risks: Construction projects involve many different hazards, including falling objects, electrical hazards, and exposure to chemicals and other substances.
- Financial risks: Construction projects can be expensive, and there is always the risk of cost overruns, delays, and other financial challenges.
- Legal risks: Construction projects are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, and there is always the risk of legal disputes or regulatory violations.
- Environmental risks: Construction projects can have significant environmental impacts, and there is always the risk of causing harm to the surrounding environment.
- Reputational risks: Construction projects are often highly visible, and there is always the risk of damaging the reputation of the project owner, the contractor, or other stakeholders.

To mitigate these risks, it is important for project owners and contractors to carefully plan and manage their construction projects, and to take steps to identify and address potential risks before they become major problems.

##### What are the risks of not following the contract?

Not following a contract can have serious legal and financial consequences. Here are some of the risks associated with not following a contract:

- Breach of contract: Failing to meet the terms of a contract can be considered a breach of contract, which can result in legal action being taken against the party that breached the contract.
- Loss of rights and remedies: If a party breaches a contract, they may lose the right to receive certain benefits or remedies that were promised in the contract.
- Loss of reputation: Failing to meet the terms of a contract can damage a party’s reputation and make it difficult for them to do business in the future.
- Financial losses: If a party breaches a contract, they may be required to pay damages or other financial compensation to the other party.
- Legal liability: In some cases, failing to meet the terms of a contract can result in legal liability, such as when a party is found to have caused harm or injury to another party.

Overall, it is important to carefully review and understand the terms of a contract before entering into it, and to take steps to ensure that the terms of the contract are met.

##### What is the contractor’s risk under JCT?

Under the Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) contract, the contractor is responsible for a range of risks and obligations. These include:

- Design risk: The contractor is responsible for the design of the works, including ensuring that the design is compliant with the requirements of the contract and any applicable laws and regulations.
- Construction risk: The contractor is responsible for the construction of the works, including ensuring that the works are completed on time, within budget, and to the required standard.
- Quality risk: The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the works are of a high quality and meet the requirements of the contract.
- Health and safety risk: The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the works are carried out in a safe and healthy manner, and for complying with all relevant health and safety laws and regulations.
- Insurance risk: The contractor is responsible for taking out and maintaining appropriate insurance cover for the works.
- Payment risk: The contractor is responsible for submitting invoices and payment claims in a timely manner, and for ensuring that they are paid in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Overall, the contractor’s risk under the JCT contract is significant and requires careful management to ensure that all risks are identified and addressed.

##### What are the three types of risks in construction?

There are several types of risks in construction, but three of the most common are:

- Financial risk: This is the risk that a construction project will cost more than expected, either due to unforeseen expenses or delays. Financial risk can be mitigated by careful planning, budgeting, and cost control.
- Schedule risk: This is the risk that a construction project will take longer than expected to complete, due

I know it sounds weird, but I really like deli meat, especially Boar's Head. I love how it smells and how it tastes. And I love it when I walk into a deli and see all those meats hanging in the window. It's so colorful, and it smells so good, and it just makes me happy.

The deli counter is one of the most important parts of a grocery store, and it's not just because it's where you buy your meat. It's also where you buy your sandwiches and salads and soups and desserts. And it's where you go to get a hot cup of coffee or a cold drink. It's where you can sit down and relax for a few minutes and watch the world go by.

But more than that, it's where you can talk to the people who work there. They're the ones who know what's going on in the neighborhood, who can tell you what's good and what's not, who can tell you where to get the best deals on groceries, and who can tell you about the latest news and gossip.

The three sit down to talk and eat deli meat, and Papa Min tells them about his passion for deli meat and how he built his empire. I've never seen a scene like this in a movie before, and I had to wonder where it came from.

In a recent interview, I asked director and writer Tom Gilroy about the scene.

"I think there was an element of wanting to make Papa Min a human being," Gilroy said. "This isn't a bad person. He's not a bad person. It's more of a tragic story in the sense that he lost his son and he was trying to make up for it by creating this empire, Boar's Head.

"But in a weird way, I think it's also a commentary on the fact that, you know, I think we've kind of lost our sense of what is good and what is bad. And what is right and what is wrong.

"And that's what I wanted to do, was just try to make a little bit of sense of what Papa Min was about, and I think there was an element of that. That it wasn't just a bad guy. I think he was a human being who was trying to make up for what he lost."

Gilroy said he wanted to make a movie about the deli meat industry, which has been in decline in the United States for decades. The film follows Min, a young man who works for Boar's Head, and his struggle to find his own identity and a sense of self-worth.

Gilroy said he was inspired by the real-life story of Jimmy Dean, the sausage magnate. "It's not just a story about the sausage industry, but it's also a story about how we've lost our sense of what is good and what is bad. And I think there's a real element of that in this movie."

> He built his company from nothing. A tiny deli in a town where everybody hated his family because they were rich. He had to find ways to be better than everyone else. So he decided that his deli would have better meat than anyone else, and he would have the widest selection. And the only way to do that was to build his own company.

And when Papa Min talks about his deli, you can almost see the deli counter, hear the slicing of the meat, and smell the sandwich meats.

When writing, we have to be able to bring a scene to life in the same way. We have to be able to evoke the senses so that the reader can experience the scene as though they were actually there.

We are, in essence, creating a movie in our reader's mind.

The easiest way to do that is to use specific details that evoke the senses. For example, when describing a character, you can do more than describe their clothes and hair. You can describe what their skin feels like, how it smells, how it tastes (if they're licking their lips), what their voice sounds like. If it's possible to use all five senses, then do so!

The next time you're at the grocery store, take a moment to notice the sights and sounds and smells. The next time you eat at a restaurant, notice the music and the lighting and the conversations going on around you. If you can capture these things in your writing, then you'll be able to bring your scene to life and your readers will be hooked!

Hi there,

In your request URL, you can add an additional parameter for currency:

--url 'https://api.privacy.com/v1/transactions?Result=APPROVED&begin=2023-01-01%2000%3A00%3A00&page=1&page\_size=50&currency=USD'

You can also find this in our documentation here: https://docs.privacy.com/docs/get-transactions

This would then limit the results to only those of the specified currency.

Hope this helps!

Best,

Mike

Hi,

I am a little confused by your request. You are using the API to retrieve information about past transactions, but you also mentioned a refund and then you said you wanted to refund via the API.

If you have an existing transaction that you want to refund, you can use the API to retrieve the ID of that transaction and use that in your refund request. This would allow you to refund a transaction that was processed using a different method.

If you want to refund a transaction that was processed using the API, you can use the refund API endpoint to process the refund. You will need to specify the ID of the transaction that you want to refund.

In either case, you can use the API to retrieve information about past transactions, but you will need to use the appropriate API endpoint to process the refund.

Best,

Mike

Hi there,

Thanks for the additional information. If you want to limit the results to only those of a specific currency, you can add an additional parameter to your request URL. The parameter is called currency and it takes a string value representing the currency code.

For example, if you wanted to limit the results to only those of the USD currency, you could add the following to your request URL:

&currency=USD

This would then limit the results to only those of the specified currency.

Best,

The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to be signed in to your Google account to make any changes. You can also control whether SafeSearch is enabled for signed-out users on your Google Account’s supervision page. The new feature is part of a larger commitment to online safety, with Google also sharing a number of updates to its products and tools to help

By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to keep in mind that even with the SafeSearch feature enabled, it won’t filter out all explicit content, as Google explains on its support page: “In general, SafeSearch isn’t 100% accurate, but it helps you avoid most adult content. Even when you turn on SafeSearch, explicit results may show up from time to time.” While the blur setting may not be entirely foolproof, it will provide another layer of protection for users who aren’t already blocking explicit content with the filter. Google’s SafeSearch filter does a good job of preventing explicit content from showing up in results, but the blur

By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to be logged in to your Google account to do so. For all other users, the blur setting will be the default. According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. SafeSearch has long been a part of Google’s services, but it’s been largely unchanged since it was introduced in 2009. SafeSearch has been the default for users under the age of 13 since 2015, and that was changed to 18 in 2021. Google has been actively developing more features for users to customize their search experience, and in September, it introduced a new tool that lets users filter out results from websites they don’t like or trust. The feature can be accessed via the three dots in the top right corner of search results, or by typing “site:” into the search bar. In addition to the new SafeSearch features, Google announced a few other updates to its search engine, such as more prominent warnings about sites with unreliable or harmful content and a redesigned safety center that’s now easier to access. The company is also adding new features to its family-

These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results.

The new feature is designed to make the search engine safer for all users, including children and families. Here’s what you need to know.

## How it works

The new feature will work in the same way as the SafeSearch filtering already in place, which allows users to block explicit results in the search results. The main difference is that the new feature will automatically blur explicit images in search results, even if SafeSearch is not enabled. Google will also be adding a new setting to allow users to turn off the blurring of explicit images. The new feature will be available for all users, including those who are not signed in to their Google accounts. It is unclear if the feature will be available for all regions or if it will be limited to certain countries. Google has not yet released any screenshots or examples of how the new feature will work. It is unclear how accurate the blurring of explicit images will be, or if it will be possible to turn off the feature. It is also unclear if the feature will be available for all types of explicit images, or if it will be limited to certain types of images. Google has not yet announced when the new feature will be available, or if there will be any additional features or changes to the search engine as a result of the new feature. It is also unclear if the new feature will be available on all platforms, or if it will be limited to certain platforms or devices. It is unclear how the new feature will affect the user experience on Google Images. It is also unclear if the new feature will affect the way that images are displayed in search results. Google has not yet released any information on the new feature. It is also unclear how the new feature will affect the way that images are indexed

It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking. Not even a single litter on the streets. It must have taken everyone\'s effort to achieve this. ~ New York. 25-10-2022I am having a great time in New York since I am able to visit places such as iconic Statue of Liberty which I have always seen in movies only. It is quite a spectacle. ~ What a day! I have to walk like a New Yorker not to stand out. The traffic in the city is blooming, the buildings got me going in circles, I got lost. New York is a place to be though, i totally love the food here. ~ December 22, 2022 Visiting New York for the holidays and unexpectedly saw my long-lost ex-girlfriend. We greeted each other and hang out for a while. During our talk, our memories just flash in my mind. We visited the statue of liberty and central park. I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

What other better place to wind up the end than the Statue of Liberty? ~ A Visit to New York21st October 2022- I visited the Statue of Liberty and learned about the establishment year22nd October 2022- I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has three sites and the establishment year is 1870.I had interesting moments , they formed part of my memories. ~ The streets are filled early in the morning as people scramble to go to work. I am here watching all these tall buildings. I am in downtown Manhattan. I decide to enter this fancy coffee shop and take some coffee to start my touring day. I am graced by the face of this gorgeous man and have butterflies in my stomach. This really marked the beginning of a great day. ~ Finally my dream of visiting New York comes a reality.My first experience of arriving in this wonderful town cant be explained in a single day. All the things in the city are wonderful.I will never forget every part of the good things I found there. ~ Day 1 just woke up and I am already too excited about seeing those skyscrapers I heard of, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire state and many more. Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking. Not even a single litter on the streets. It must have taken everyone\'s effort to achieve this. ~ New York. 25-10-2022I am having a great time in New York since I am able to visit places such as iconic Statue of Liberty which I have always seen in movies only. It is quite a spectacle. ~ What a day! I have to walk like a New Yorker not to stand out. The traffic in the city is blooming, the buildings got me going in circles, I got lost. New York is a place to be though, i totally love the food here. ~ December 22, 2022 Visiting New York for the holidays and unexpectedly saw my long-lost ex-girlfriend. We greeted each other and hang out for a while. During our talk, our memories just flash in my mind. We visited the statue of liberty and central park. I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry). I am so much ready to be off this plane. ~ New York, is the place where many people's dreams come true. There are many places where you can visit New York and enjoy. I really want to tell people that they should visit here once at least. Anyhow, if I can get any chance to visit here I will come here again you visit here once As a tourist place, it is awesome to enjoy with fairly and friends. ~ New York, is one of the best places I have ever visited.there are many places where you can travel and enjoy yourself with your family and friend. I have never seen a place such beautiful and shining. If I have a chance to visit again here I will definitely come here one more time, I love this place and I can suggest you visit here once.

I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But everyone is busy and in a hurry to get somewhere. ~ Today I woke up very early in order to have enough time to check as many destinations as possible. Central Park was obviously the first on the list, being the closest to my hotel. I couldn't have missed the Statue of Liberty and also the Madison Square Garden where the New York Knicks play. Then I finished up by visiting the set of the movie Once Upon a Time in America. ~ I had always dreamt of seeing the famous New york City. Today, day had come. Standing on the roof top of Entire State Building, looking down, I saw how busy the street was.Ffrom people walking around doing business while others queued on the traffic. This is just a normal night in New York City. ~ This is my first time visiting the City That Never Sleeps. May I say that this isn't how I imagined it to be? Because what I've seen right now far exceeds my expectations. I can feel NYC embracing me like it isn't my first time visiting this place. I feel different from others here, yet I still fit.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

[30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us.

We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9 percent of spam, phishing, and malware from ever reaching your inbox. We’re also investing in a team of top machine learning experts to protect your account from malicious behavior, and are working with governments to share our AI tools to help protect our collective safety online.

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking. Not even a single litter on the streets. It must have taken everyone\'s effort to achieve this. ~ New York. 25-10-2022I am having a great time in New York since I am able to visit places such as iconic Statue of Liberty which I have always seen in movies only. It is quite a spectacle. ~ What a day! I have to walk like a New Yorker not to stand out. The traffic in the city is blooming, the buildings got me going in circles, I got lost. New York is a place to be though, i totally love the food here. ~ December 22, 2022 Visiting New York for the holidays and unexpectedly saw my long-lost ex-girlfriend. We greeted each other and hang out for a while. During our talk, our memories just flash in my mind. We visited the statue of liberty and central park. I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry). I am so much ready to be off this plane. ~ New York, is the place where many people's dreams come true. There are many places where you can visit New York and enjoy. I really want to tell people that they should visit here once at least. Anyhow, if I can get any chance to visit here I will come here again you visit here once As a tourist place, it is awesome to enjoy with fairly and friends. ~ New York, is one of the best places I have ever visited.there are many places where you can travel and enjoy yourself with your family and friend. I have never seen a place such beautiful and shining. If I have a chance to visit again here I will definitely come here one more time, I love this place and I can suggest you visit here once. This is one of the best tourist places I have ever visited. ~ 28/10/2022 New York. All the things I've heard of New York are true. The diverse culture, the food and the party scene are all too great. I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But everyone is busy and in a hurry to get somewhere. ~ Today I woke up very early in order to have enough time to check as many destinations as possible. Central Park was obviously the first on the list, being the closest to my hotel. I couldn't have missed the Statue of Liberty and also the Madison Square Garden where the New York Knicks play. Then I finished up by visiting the set of the movie Once Upon a Time in America. ~ I had always dreamt of seeing the famous New york City. Today, day had come. Standing on the roof top of Entire State Building, looking down, I saw how busy the street was.Ffrom people walking around doing business while others queued on the traffic. This is just a normal night in New York City. ~ This is my first time visiting the City That Never Sleeps. May I say that this isn't how I imagined it to be? Because what I've seen right now far exceeds my expectations. I can feel NYC embracing me like it isn't my first time visiting this place. I feel different from others here, yet I still fit.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

In addition, we work to identify and remove fake accounts and prevent scams on YouTube before they cause harm. And, we remove more than 500,000 harmful apps from the Google Play Store every year. In fact, our Safe Browsing technology now protects over 5 billion devices every day. While we’ve made great strides in online safety, we still have a long way to go. We hope this Safer Internet Day can be a catalyst to continue the conversations that help us all build a safer online world.

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to exercise their functions in a particular way. 5

Practitioner / Person / Person / Person

2021

The Act, as noted above, does not define “practitioners” to include “persons” who carry out work of the kind described in the definition of “practitioner”. The use of the word “practitioners” in the context of s 29(3) indicates that the word does not have the same meaning as “persons” in other provisions of the Act. This is not surprising. If it did, s 29(3) would apply not only to “persons” who were registered practitioners but also to “persons” who were not registered practitioners, including, relevantly, registered building practitioners. 31. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to exercise their functions in a particular way. As I have said, the word “practitioners” does not have the same meaning as “persons” in other provisions of the Act. The word “practitioners” has a more limited meaning, as explained above. In my opinion, the words “a person” in s 29(3) refer only to registered practitioners. 32. In his third message, Mr Bashford submitted that the word “practitioner” in s 29(3) “means a person who carries out work in their relevant field of expertise” and that the definition of “practitioner” in s 3 is a “non-exhaustive definition”. Mr Bashford did not say what words in the Act would indicate that the definition of “practitioner” is non-exhaustive. Nor did he refer to any case where a definition of “practitioner” was held to be non-exhaustive. The word “practitioner” in s 29(3) does not mean a “person” who carries out work in their relevant field of expertise, but is limited to “persons” who are registered practitioners, as I have explained. The word “practitioners” is defined in the Act as follows: “practitioner means a person who carries out work in the

A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of malware, phishing and spam. But we can’t fight this battle alone. We’re continuing to work with partners across the industry to make our collective platforms more secure, and with more than 100,000 organizations in more than 100 countries using our tools, we’re making progress together. We’re also continuing to develop advanced technologies, like our AI-based spam protections and our new Password Leak Detection feature that Google Chrome will soon offer. In the meantime, we encourage everyone to turn on two-step verification and create strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. We’re committed to helping keep you safe online and will continue to share more ways to do so.

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

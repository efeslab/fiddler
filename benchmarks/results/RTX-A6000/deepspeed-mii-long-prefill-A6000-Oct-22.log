These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to be

Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

[27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13.

INFO:root:input text: ['\\section{Methods} This section introduces HAMLET, a framework for \\textbf{H}ardware-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{M}odular \\textbf{L}east \\textbf{E}xpensive \\textbf{T}raining. %We employ state-of-the-art UDA methods~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer, dacs}. We design a novel framework to tackle online domain adaptation with real-time performance. We tackle this problem with several synergistic strategies. First, we introduce a Hardware-Aware Modular Training (HAMT) agent able to optimize online a trade-off between model accuracy and adaptation time. HAMT allows us to significantly reduce online training time and GFlops. Nevertheless, the cheapest training consists of not training at all. Therefore, as the second strategy, we introduce a formal geometric model of online domain shifts that enable reliable domain shift detection and domain estimator signals (Adaptive Domain Detection, Sec.~\\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}). These can be easily integrated to activate the adaptation process only at specific times, \\textit{as least as possible}. Moreover, we can further leverage these signals by designing adaptive training policies that dynamically adapt domain-sensitive hyperparameters. We refer to these methodologies as Active Training Modulation. We present an overview of HAMLET in Fig.~\\ref{fig:architecture}. \\subsection{Model setup} We employ DAFormer~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer} as our starting point, coupling state-of-the-art UDA methods~\\cite{dacs} with SegFormer~\\cite{xie2021segformer} as segmentation backbone -- this latter because it brings strong generalization capacity. The student model is assisted by two teachers during training: an EMA teacher (updated as exponential-moving-average of the student) and a static source-pretrained model. The student is fed with images mixing target and source, and supervised with a ``mixed-sample" loss computed against labels mixing EMA teacher pseudo-labels and source annotations (pseudo-loss). To regularize the student, we also employ a feature distance loss with the static teacher and a supervised loss, both computed using source samples stored in a replay buffer.%\\matteo{On top of it, we introduce our contributions.} \\subsection{Hardware-aware modular training (HAMT)} \\label{subs:hardware-aware-modular-training} Online adaption requires updates of the parameters during deployment time. However, back-propagation is computationally expensive and hence too slow to be continuously applied on a deployed agent. Opting for a partial weight update, for example finetuning the last module of the network, would enable much better training time. Nevertheless, domain shifts can manifest as changes in both the data input distribution (attributes of the images, \\eg{} day/night) and the output distribution (\\eg{} classes priors). These information could be encoded in different parts of the network, therefore just updating the very last segment might not suffice. This motivates a need to orchestrate the training process, to ensure sufficient training while minimizing the computational overhead. Inspired by reward-punishment~\\cite{tonioni2019real} and reinforcement learning~\\cite{wang2018haq} policies, we introduce an orchestration agent in charge of deciding how deeply the network shall be fine-tuned as a trade-off between the pseudo-loss minimization rate and the computational time. In contrast to previous efficient back-propagation approaches~\\cite{wei2017minimal, jiang2019accelerating, cheng2022stochastic}, our model is pretrained on the task and thus requires smaller updates to adapt. Let us start by modeling the problem. Our model backbone, $f$, is composed of four different modules: $ %\\begin{equation} f = m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3 \\circ m\\_2 \\circ m\\_1 %\\end{equation} $. This defines our action space $\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\mathrm{T\\_1}, \\mathrm{T\\_2}, \\mathrm{T\\_3}, \\mathrm{T\\_4}\\}$ where $\\mathrm{T\\_4}$ corresponds to training just the last module of the network, $m\\_4$, while $\\mathrm{T\\_3}$ the last two modules, \\ie{} $m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3$, $\\mathrm{T\\_2}$ the last three, \\ie{} $m\\_4 \\circ m\\_3 \\circ m\\_2$, and $\\mathrm{T\\_1}$ the whole network $f$. We also define a continuous state space $\\mathcal{S}=\\{\\mathrm{R}, \\mathrm{V}\\}$ where $\\mathrm{R}$ is the second derivative of the EMA teacher pseudo-loss over time-steps, hence $\\mathrm{R}=-\\frac{d^2 l}{d t^2}$. $\\mathrm{V}$ represents instead a cumulative rewards vector with the same dimension as the action space $\\mathcal{A}$, initialized at zero. Now we have everything in place to employ an expected-improvement based decision model. At every time step $t$ we select the action as $a\\_t = T\\_j | j = \\operatorname\\*{argmax} \\mathrm{V\\_t}$. In the training step $\\mathrm{t}$, $\\mathrm{V\\_j}$ is updated as { \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:naive\\_update} \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t+1}} = R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) \\end{equation} } where $\\alpha$ is a smoothing factor, \\textit{\\eg{}} $0.1$. Since $R\\_t$ represents the negative acceleration of the pseudo-loss of a given instant $t$ and $\\mathrm{V\\_{t}}$ is updated as an integration over $t$ of $R\\_t$, we can see $\\mathrm{V\\_{t}}$ as the expected pseudo-loss negative velocity, $ - \\frac{d l}{d t}$. Therefore, our policy can be seen as a greedy module selection based on the expected pseudo-loss reduction maximization. A notable drawback of this policy is that we will inevitably converge towards picking more rewarding, yet expensive, actions \\ie{} $\\mathrm{T\\_1}, \\mathrm{T\\_2}$ compared to more efficient but potentially less effective actions \\ie{} $\\mathrm{T\\_3}, \\mathrm{T\\_4}$. However, our goal is not to maximize $ - \\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta t}$ where $\\Delta t$ is the number of updates, our goal is instead to maximize $ - \\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta \\tau}$ where $\\Delta \\tau$ is a real time interval. Therefore, we have to introduce in the optimization policy some notion of the actual training cost of each action in $\\mathcal{A}$ on the target device. To start with, we measure the training time associated with each action, obtaining $\\omega\\_T = \\{ \\omega\\_{T\\_1}, \\omega\\_{T\\_2}, \\omega\\_{T\\_3}, \\omega\\_{T\\_4} \\}$. With this we can compute the time-conditioning vector $\\gamma$ as { \\small \\begin{equation} \\gamma\\_i=\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega\\_{T\\_i}} }}{\\sum\\_{j=1}^K e^{\\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega\\_{T\\_j}}}} \\quad \\text{ for } i=1, \\ldots, K \\end{equation} } where $\\beta$ is the softmax temperature, and $K$ the number of actions, \\ie{} 4 in our model. Therefore, we modify our update policy to favor less computationally expensive modules by scaling the updates with $\\gamma$, so that Eq.~\\ref{eq:naive\\_update} becomes: { \\small \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t+1}} = \\begin{cases} \\gamma\\_j R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) & \\textrm{if } R\\_t \\geq 0\\\\ (1 - \\gamma\\_j) R\\_t \\alpha + \\mathrm{V\\_{j,t}} (1 - \\alpha) & \\textrm{if } R\\_t < 0\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation} } This policy makes it so that more expensive actions receive smaller rewards and larger punishments. Despite its simplicity, this leads to a significant reduction in FLOPS for an average back-propagation $\\beta$, \\ie{} $-30\\%$ with $\\beta=2.75$ or $-43\\%$ with $\\beta=1$. We finally choose $\\beta=1.75$ to obtain a FLOPS reduction of $-34\\%$. Extensive ablations are presented in the \\textbf{supplementary material}. \\subsection{Active training modulation} \\label{subs:active-training-modulation} Continuous and test-time adaptation methods tackle online learning as a continuous and constant process carried out on the data stream. Nevertheless, this approach presents several shortcomings when it comes to real-world deployments. Performing adaptation when the deployment domain is unchanged does not lead to further performance improvements on the current domain; instead, might cause significant forgetting on previous domains, hence hindering model generalization (we present evidence of this in the \\textbf{supplementary material}). Moreover, even if mitigated with Hardware-Aware Modular Training, online training remains a computationally expensive procedure. However, knowing when and what kind of adaptation is needed is not a trivial task. We tackle this by introducing an Adaptive Domain Detector mechanism, Sec.~\\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}, and then a set of strategies to reduce the training time while optimizing the learning rate accordingly, Sec.~\\ref{subs:learning-rate-scheduling}. \\subsubsection{Adaptive domain detection} \\label{subs:adaptive-domain-detection} A key element of the online adaptation system consists of acquiring awareness of the trajectory in the data distribution space, \\ie{} domains, described by the student model during deployment. We can model the problem by setting the trajectory origin in the source domain. With high dimensional data, the data distribution is not tractable, therefore the trajectory model cannot be described in closed form. Nevertheless, recent work~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022} introduced the notion of distance between the current deployed domain and source by approximating it with the confidence drop of a source pretrained model. This approach heavily relies on the assumption that the pretrained model is well calibrated. While this might hold for domains close to source, the calibration quickly degrades in farther domains~\\cite{shift, Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}. This myopic behavior limits the simple use of confidence for domain detection. Furthermore, the additional forward pass on a pretrained model significantly increases the computational cost during deployment. We tackle these limitations with an equivalently simple, yet more robust, approach. We modify the backbone of the static teacher model used for feature distance loss $f^\\text{fd}$ by connecting an extremely lightweight segmentation head, $d^\\text{fd}\\_{1}$, after the first encoder module $m\\_{1}^\\text{fd}$: $ %\\begin{equation} h^\\text{fd}\\_{1} = d^\\text{fd}\\_{1} \\circ m^\\text{fd}\\_{1} %\\end{equation} $. This additional decoder, $h^\\text{fd}\\_{1}$, is trained offline, on source data, without propagating gradients in the backbone architecture. Instead of relying on the confidence of this model, given a target sample $x\\_T$, we propose to compute the cross-entropy between the one-hot encoded student prediction $p(x\\_T) = 1\\_{\\operatorname\\*{argmax}(f(x\\_T))}$ and the lightweight decoder prediction $g(x\\_T) = h^\\text{fd}\\_{1}(x\\_T)$ as \\begin{equation} %L\\_T^{(i)}=-\\sum\\_{j=1}^{H \\times W} \\sum\\_{c=1}^C p\\_T^{(i, j, c)} \\log g\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right)^{(j, c)} % This should also work, whatever you prefer H\\_T^{(i)}=-\\sum\\_{j=1}^{H \\times W} \\sum\\_{c=1}^C p\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right) \\left.\\log g\\left(x\\_T^{(i)}\\right)\\right|\\_{j,c} \\end{equation} Thanks to higher generalization capability (both due to larger number of parameters and unsupervised adaptation process), the student model will always outperform the lightweight decoder head. Nevertheless, since now the distance is measured in the prediction space, we are not subjected to model miscalibration. Furthermore, since the student model is in constant adaptation, the domain distance accuracy actually improves over time, leading to better results. We present evidence of these claims in the \\textbf{supplementary material}. We can now define a denoised signal by using bin-averaging $A\\_T^{(i)}=\\sum\\_{j=mi}^{m(i+1)-1}\\frac{H\\_T^{(j)}}{m}$ where $m$ is the bin size. Then, new domains are modeled as discretized steps of $A\\_T^{(i)}$ as { \\small \\begin{equation} B\\_0 = A\\_0 \\qquad B\\_i = \\begin{cases} A\\_i & \\textrm{if $|B\\_i - A\\_i|>z$} \\\\ B\\_{i-1} & \\textrm{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation} } Where $B$ is the discretized signal and $z$ is the minimum distance used to identify new domains. Finally, we can model the signed amplitude of domain shifts as $S\\_i = B\\_i - B\\_{i-1}$. % \\subsubsection{Least Training and Adaptive Learning Rate} \\label{subs:learning-rate-scheduling} %Now that we have set forth a framework able to express a notion of the current domain, $B$, and occurring domain shifts, $ S$, as a quantitative signals, we can finally control the training phases of the model accordingly. Given the definitions of $B$, and $S$, we can control the training phases accordingly. %First, We decide to trigger the adaptation only when facing a new domain, in a \\textit{Least Training} fashion (LT), \\ie{} when $|S\\_i| > 0$. %and to and orchestrate other training parameters. %Furthermore, we can now go one step further and orchestrate other training parameters. Moreover, we employ an Adaptive Learning Rate strategy (ALR), to orchestrate the other training parameters. Online learning performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate, $\\eta$, learning rate decaying rate, and number of iterations $l$. We can operate on them to ease adaptation according to the specific domain shift we are facing. For instance, the larger the domain shift, \\ie{} $|S\\_i|$, the more we need to adapt to counter its effect -- either by running more optimization steps or using higher learning rate. While if we are moving to domains closer to source, fewer adaptation steps will be necessary. Here we present some policies able to boost online learning performances both in accuracy and FPS. For this purpose we need to define a few signals synchronized with the iterations of the network, namely: $\\eta\\_j$ which contains the learning rate at iteration $j$; $l\\_j$ which contains the iteration when the network started training; $L\\_j$ which contains the iteration when the network is expected to stop training. Note that $mi \\leqslant j < m(i+1)$ and $l\\_j \\leqslant j \\leqslant L\\_j$. By convention, we specify that the training is inhibited whenever $l\\_j = L\\_j$. \\subsubsection{Dynamic ClassMix (DCM)} ClassMix~\\cite{olsson2021classmix} provides a simple mechanism for data augmentation by mixing classes from the source dataset into target images. Usually 50\\% of the classes in the source dataset are selected, however we notice that this percentage is a highly sensitive hyperparameter in online domain adaptation. Injecting a significant portion of source classes has a beneficial impact when adapting to domains closer to the source domain, whereas when adapting to domains further from the source the opposite effect can be observed, as it effectively slows down the adaptation process. We therefore exploit once more the deployment domain awareness to control the mixing augmentation: % THIS IS THE PROBLEM, KEEP THE TWO AWAY! :D (footnotesize is the assassin) % ok - but weird - lol { \\footnotesize \\begin{equation} \\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM} = K\\_{\\text{CM},\\text{min}} + \\frac{(B\\_\\textrm{i}-B\\_\\textrm{source})(K\\_\\textrm{CM,max}-K\\_\\textrm{CM,min})}{B\\_\\textrm{hard}-B\\_\\textrm{source}}. \\end{equation} } where $\\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM}$ is the percentage of source classes used during adaptation; and $K\\_\\textrm{CM, min}$ (resp. $K\\_\\textrm{CM, max}$) is the value of $\\tilde K\\_\\textrm{CM}$ assigned when the network is close to (resp. far away from) the source domain. \\subsubsection{Buffer sampling} Following~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}, to simulate real deployment, we limit our accessibility to the source domain by using a replay buffer. Additionally, instead of initializing at random (with uniform prior), we apply Rare Class Sampling (RCS) (skewed priors) as in~\\cite{hoyer2021daformer}. This incentives a more balanced class distribution over the buffer, ultimately leading to better accuracy.']
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> \section{Methods} This section introduces HAMLET, a framework for \textbf{H}ardware-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}odular \textbf{L}east \textbf{E}xpensive \textbf{T}raining. %We employ state-of-the-art UDA methods~\cite{hoyer2021daformer, dacs}. We design a novel framework to tackle online domain adaptation with real-time performance. We tackle this problem with several synergistic strategies. First, we introduce a Hardware-Aware Modular Training (HAMT) agent able to optimize online a trade-off between model accuracy and adaptation time. HAMT allows us to significantly reduce online training time and GFlops. Nevertheless, the cheapest training consists of not training at all. Therefore, as the second strategy, we introduce a formal geometric model of online domain shifts that enable reliable domain shift detection and domain estimator signals (Adaptive Domain Detection, Sec.~\ref{subs:adaptive-domain-detection}). These can be easily integrated to activate the adaptation process only at specific times, \textit{as least as possible}. Moreover, we can further leverage these signals by designing adaptive training policies that dynamically adapt domain-sensitive hyperparameters. We refer to these methodologies as Active Training Modulation. We present an overview of HAMLET in Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}. \subsection{Model setup} We employ DAFormer~\cite{hoyer2021daformer} as our starting point, coupling state-of-the-art UDA methods~\cite{dacs} with SegFormer~\cite{xie2021segformer} as segmentation backbone -- this latter because it brings strong generalization capacity. The student model is assisted by two teachers during training: an EMA teacher (updated as exponential-moving-average of the student) and a static source-pretrained model.

Meaning of brand name Ioni is an eco-friendly lifestyle brand that can be used throughout the house, starting with foam-free laundry detergent, deodorization and cleaning. The current brand name, Ioni, comes from the abbreviation of "mineral ion water" into an easy-to-call word. 2. When and when to start the online store Han Seo-yoon, CEO of the suspicious research institute that runs Ioni. Employees working at a natural detergent factory came out and opened an online store. Household sewage is actually the biggest cause of water pollution. It was a bit disappointing that we overlooked that, so we made a product called Ioni and created an online store with the same name as a way to drastically reduce household sewage. It currently produces and supplies Ioni, which is in its fifth year 5. 3. Sales Products and Business Models Ioni undiluted solution is an ultra-high concentrated undiluted solution made of 100% food additives and can be diluted in water. It can be washed, cleaned, and deodorized without bubbles. Bubble is the biggest culprit of water pollution. It researches and introduces various recipes and products so that you can live without foaming surfactants. Plastic containers for undiluted liquids are collected and reused to reduce plastic usage. 4. What was the most difficult thing about operation and how to overcome it? It is not easy to make a profit. We are overcoming this in various ways. For example, since it is a brand that changes the package and actively accepts customers\' opinions, this time it is changing the lid or something like this, or expanding the lineup a little. It is a very safe detergent or a very unfamiliar concept for ordinary consumers. Therefore, after using Ioni since its launch, a free refund system has been implemented if you are dissatisfied. There has never been a refund in five years. 5. A company\'s growth story, including key indicators such as sales and membership numbers. Over the past five years, we\'ve sold 60,000 to 70,000 units. As you can see through Kakao Makers Wadiz, customer satisfaction is almost 95%. The repurchase rate is also about 60 percent. It publishes a report of Eco Social Impact every month. This report introduced a reduction of about 160 million liters of contaminated water and 64 million liters of rinse water from September 2019 to October 2022. In addition, more than 6,000 empty bottles were collected and reused, reducing about 7 tons of plastic. If you collect more than five Ioni bottles, you will receive a 500 won deposit for each bottle when you collect them online for free or return them to a nearby refill station. A reusable package project is underway to reuse these collected empty bottles. 6. A word of advice to anyone who starts an online store. When I interviewed about branding, I talked about small brands. I don\'t think even the value is small just because it\'s small. Although we are a very small company now, I think we are doing very, very valuable things, so anyone who wants to share these values \u200b\u200band philosophies can create and run a brand. I don\'t want anyone to be afraid to start. 7. Differentiating points from competitive brands It can be washed in large quantities with very small amounts. Our Ioni detergent can be used in hand laundry or washing machines, starting with sterilization of laundry tanks. It is competitive compared to the fact that the detergent industry has increased its volume and is dividing and selling it by detergent use. It provides a recipe that can make up to 30,000 liters of deodorized water with one liter of Ioni original Ioni detergent. In addition, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as cleaning fruits and vegetables or deodorizing water for pets. 8. Proud partnership or attraction investment We are continuously working with these companies to reduce carbon emissions, eco-related events, and cooperation with such companies. Not too long ago, I gave a lecture at a university student named Inactors, and a student at Ewha Womans University who found out about our product said that he wanted to run a pop-up store in Ewha Womans University, so we did a pop -up store. 9. Future growth strategies and expansion plans for the company It started for home use, but it is estimated that less than 1% of it will be used in Korea. If you do laundry only once a day at home, you will discharge about 84 liters of contaminated water. At least 84 liters of contaminated water can be reduced by running the washing machine once a day in each household and once a day in each household. Our dream is to reduce the amount of contaminated water by changing it to such an eco-friendly detergent, even if it is not our Ioni, even if it is only 10% of Korea. 10. Plans for overseas expansion We went to an early childhood fair in Jakarta, Indonesia, and it was so popular that we had a meeting with many buyers. Many companies have contacted us in Japan, so we are planning to export a little to Japan this time. 11. The reason why Cafe 24 was chosen as the online store construction platform. I don\'t have to tell you this, but I think everyone knows. Cafe24 was also the largest hosting company in Korea and it was good in that it could implement almost all the functions I wanted. At first, free templates and things like that were very well done and I liked that there was a responsive template. The design is... We don\'t have a designer in our company. We\'re even designing it ourselves. There are many things to change the detail page from time to time, but if you use Edibot, you can easily and easily change and create the detail page even if you can\'t handle design tools, so I chose Cafe24 in that regard.번역결과The following are questions and answers from an interview with the CEO of eco-friendly detergent brand ‘Ioni’, a Cafe24 customer.

It is competitive compared to the fact that the detergent industry has increased its volume and is dividing and selling it by detergent use. It provides a recipe that can make up to 30,000 liters of deodorized water with one liter of Ioni original Ioni detergent. In addition, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as cleaning fruits and vegetables or deodorizing water for pets. 8. Proud partnership or attraction investment We are continuously working with these companies to reduce carbon emissions, eco-related events, and cooperation with such companies. Not too long ago, I gave a lecture at a university student named Inactors, and a student at Ewha Womans University who found out about our product said that he wanted to run a pop-up store in Ewha Womans University, so we did a pop -up store. 9. Future growth strategies and expansion plans for the company It started for home use, but it is estimated that less than 1% of it will be used in Korea. If you do laundry only once a day at home, you will discharge about 84 liters of contaminated water. At least 84 liters of contaminated water can be reduced by running the washing machine once a day in each household and once a day in each household. Our dream is to reduce the amount of contaminated water by changing it to such an eco-friendly detergent, even if it is not our Ioni, even if it is only 10% of Korea. 10. Plans for overseas expansion We went to an early childhood fair in Jakarta, Indonesia, and it was so popular that we had a meeting with many buyers. Many companies have contacted us in Japan, so we are planning to export a little to Japan this time. 11. The reason why Cafe 24 was chosen as the online store construction platform. I don\'t have to tell you this, but I think everyone knows. Cafe24 was also the largest hosting company in Korea and it was good in that it could implement almost all the functions I wanted. At first, free templates and things like that were very well done and I liked that there was a responsive template. The design is... We don\'t have a designer in our company. We\'re even designing it ourselves. There are many things to change the detail page from time to time, but if you use Edibot, you can easily and easily change and create the detail page even if you can\'t handle design tools, so I chose Cafe24 in that regard.']

Meaning of brand name Ioni is an eco-friendly lifestyle brand that can be used throughout the house, starting with foam-free laundry detergent, deodorization and cleaning. The current brand name, Ioni, comes from the abbreviation of "mineral ion water" into an easy-to-call word. 2. When and when to start the online store Han Seo-yoon, CEO of the suspicious research institute that runs Ioni. Employees working at a natural detergent factory came out and opened an online store. Household sewage is actually the biggest cause of water pollution. It was a bit disappointing that we overlooked that, so we made a product called Ioni and created an online store with the same name as a way to drastically reduce household sewage. It currently produces and supplies Ioni, which is in its fifth year 5. 3. Sales Products and Business Models Ioni undiluted solution is an ultra-high concentrated undiluted solution made of 100% food additives and can be diluted in water. It can be washed, cleaned, and deodorized without bubbles. Bubble is the biggest culprit of water pollution. It researches and introduces various recipes and products so that you can live without foaming surfactants. Plastic containers for undiluted liquids are collected and reused to reduce plastic usage. 4. What was the most difficult thing about operation and how to overcome it? It is not easy to make a profit. We are overcoming this in various ways. For example, since it is a brand that changes the package and actively accepts customers' opinions, this time it is changing the lid or something like this, or expanding the lineup a little. It is a very safe detergent or a very unfamiliar concept for ordinary consumers. Therefore, after using Ioni since its launch, a free refund system has been implemented if you are dissatisfied. There has never been a refund in five years. 5. A company's growth story, including key indicators such as sales and membership numbers. Over the past five years, we've sold 60,000 to 70,000 units. As you can see through Kakao Makers Wadiz, customer satisfaction is almost 95%. The repurchase rate is also about 60 percent. It publishes a report of Eco Social Impact every month. This report introduced a reduction of about 160 million liters of contaminated water and 64 million liters of rinse water from September 2019 to October 2022. In addition, more than 6,000 empty bottles were collected and reused, reducing about 7 tons of plastic. If you collect more than five Ioni bottles, you will receive a 500 won deposit for each bottle when you collect them online for free or return them to a nearby refill station. A reusable package project is underway to reuse these collected empty bottles. 6. A word of advice to anyone who starts an online store. When I interviewed about branding, I talked about small brands. I don't think even the value is small just because it's small. Although we are a very small company now, I think we are doing very, very valuable things, so anyone who wants to share these values ​​and philosophies can create and run a brand. I don't want anyone to be afraid to start. 7. Differentiating points from competitive brands It can be washed in large quantities with very small amounts. Our Ioni detergent can be used in hand laundry or washing machines, starting with sterilization of laundry tanks. It is competitive compared to the fact that the detergent industry has increased its volume and is dividing and selling it by detergent use.

Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK The information in this document is provided as a guide only and is not professional advice, including legal advice.

If such a vehicle is imported from the UK (including via NI), the importer is required to complete a Customs import declaration, pay Customs Duty, if applicable and Value Added Tax (VAT) on import, prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being completed by the NCT centres. Vehicles purchased from NI, that were in NI prior to 1 January 2021, are treated as EU goods and no customs formalities are required and VAT on import and customs duty are not applicable. However, where vehicles from Great Britain (GB) are moved to the EU, through NI, after 31 December 2020, including those re-registered to an NI owner, then customs formalities and VAT on import may apply. Full information on the requirements for importing second-hand vehicles is available on the Revenue website here. An overview of vehicle import scenarios is outlined in Appendix 1. 2 Pre-requirements to make a Customs Import Declaration If a vehicle is imported from the UK, then a customs declaration is required. This is usually completed by a customs agent on behalf of the importer. However, an individual can also complete the declaration using the declaration portal in Revenue’s import system, AIS. To complete a customs import declaration an individual must: \uf0b7 Be registered for Revenue Online Service (ROS) \uf0b7 Be registered for Customs & Excise \uf0b7 Have an EORI number If not already registered for ROS, for example if you are a PAYE employee, then a registration request can be submitted through MyEnquiries. Please include your PPS number and brief note on the reason for the request. This can be submitted through the following path: 1) Sign into MyEnquiries 2) Select \'Add new Enquiry\' 3) In the \'My Enquiry relates to\' section, enter \'Customs\': Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 4 4) In the \'More Specifically\' section, enter \'eCustoms - Systems Query\' for enquiries relating to AEP (Import & Export Declarations), EORI, EMS, NCTS, ICS and CD. If it is not possible to register for MyEnquiries then the request can be sent by e-mail to ecustoms@revenue.ie On receipt, eCustoms will register the applicant for C&E and complete an EORI registration which will enable the import of the motor vehicle. Once registration is confirmed by eCustoms, the next step is to register for ROS on www.revenue.ie . Registration for ROS will provide access to the AIS trader portal and allow submission of an import declaration. If importing a new vehicle into the State, the following information must be attached to the import declaration: \uf0b7 A valid Certificate of Conformity (CoC) that confirms EU type approval. Please note that the type approval number on the CoC must correspond to an EU Member State. or \uf0b7 An Individual Approval or Small Series Approval Certificate issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 5 3 Customs Import Declaration Submission The type of declaration required is a “H1” import declaration Step 1: Log into ROS (guidance here) Step 2: Select the ‘Customs UCC Portal’ under the My Services tab – Other Services Figure 1: ROS Customs UCC Portal Step 3: Follow the guidance on inputting a H1 customs declaration in the Customs UCC Portal here. 4 Combined Nomenclature Code Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes are set out in TARIC. Vehicles are classified for customs purposes under goods code: 8700000000. This will be further broken down by the vehicle type (i.e. motor vehicle – 8703) and then the specifics of the particular vehicle. The CN code is entered at Data Element (DE) 6/15 (Commodity Code – TARIC Code) on the customs import declaration. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 6 The most common vehicle is: 870321 - Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of <10 persons, incl. station wagons and racing cars, with only spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine of a cylinder capacity <= 1.000 cm³ (excl. vehicles for travelling on snow and other specially designed vehicles of subheading 870310). NOTE: there is a different code for new and used vehicles \uf0b7 8703211000 – new vehicle \uf0b7 8703219000– used vehicle 5 Vehicle Identification Number IMPORTANT: The inclusion of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is critical. From 1 January 2021, to enable an imported vehicle to be cleared by the NCT centre, evidence of a customs import declaration must be provided at the NCT centre. There will also be an electronic interface between the NCT centre and the Revenue Customs system, therefore the correct VIN must be entered on the customs import declaration. Procedure at Import: When completing your customs import declaration, at DE 2/3, insert 1D97 followed by the VIN. It should be noted that 1D97 (VIN) should be included at Goods Shipment item level. NOTE: If the item being imported does not have a VIN, please insert the text NOVIN033 after 1D97. 6 Transfer of Residence Persons transferring their residence should include their private vehicles on their Transfer of Residence (TOR) declaration form (C&E 1076), which covers the importation of personal items and household goods from outside the EU. There is more information on how to claim TOR relief on the Revenue website. If an importer qualifies for TOR relief, no Customs Duty or VAT on import is payable on the vehicle(s). If you are personally importing your personal items and household goods and you are physically with the goods, then an electronic customs import declaration may not be necessary. For further assistance contact Customs Clearance and Import or Export Controls on 01-7383685 or through Revenue MyEnquiries. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 7 7 UK Origin Vehicles From 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain, where the relevant rules on origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. However, goods of EU origin that are in use in the UK and that are subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate, as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. Further information on preferential tariff treatment and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 7.1 Where the Vehicle is UK Origin Where the vehicle was manufactured in the UK and complies with the origin terms as set out in the EU-UK TCA, a preferential tariff rate of 0% may be claimed. To claim preferential origin for UK origin goods for release into free circulation in the EU, the following codes are used: \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 4/17 (Preference) should contain the code ‘300’. \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 5/16 (Country of preferential origin) is ‘GB’. \uf0b7 AIS Data Element 2/3 (Documents produced, certificates and authorisations, additional references), one of the following codes should be used: - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a \'statement on origin’ for a single shipment, use code “U116”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on ‘importer’s knowledge’, use code “U117”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a \'statement on origin’ for multiple shipments of identical products, use code “U118”. A list of codes which may be applicable is available in Appendix 2. 8 Returned Goods Relief Returned Goods Relief may be available, subject to conditions, for vehicles that have been exported from the Customs territory of the Union. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3 rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are: Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 8 \uf0b7 The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU \uf0b7 Must not have been altered and \uf0b7 Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. Further information on the relief and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 9 Postponed Accounting for VAT Postponed accounting for VAT on import is now available to all VAT registered traders. Revenue may exclude traders who do not fulfil certain conditions and requirements from using this scheme. This scheme: \uf0b7 provides for postponed accounting for VAT on imports from non-EU countries \uf0b7 enables you to account for import VAT on your VAT return \uf0b7 allows you to reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared in a return. This is subject to normal rules on deductibility. More information on postponed accounting is available here. 10 Importing a Vehicle from Northern Ireland Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods. The result is that there are no Customs formalities, including Customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, in January 2021, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used vehicles imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain, and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. A vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has remained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations. However, proof of the vehicle’s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 will be required, for example: \uf0b7 a ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle \uf0b7 a copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 9 \uf0b7 tax and insurance details indicating use in NI prior to 1 January 2021 or \uf0b7 a copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021. Where a second-hand vehicle has been imported from Great Britain after 31 December 2020 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on Import on Used Vehicles must be made to Revenue in respect of any vehicles that qualify for the UK VAT margin scheme. If you do not have proof of a declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland you must complete a Customs import declaration and pay Customs Duty, if applicable, and VAT on the customs value of the vehicle plus the customs duty payable – see examples at para 12 below. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Full details are available in Appendix 3. 11 Payment If registered for ROS, you must also be registered for Customs & Excise (C&E) and have an Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) to make payments for C&E. Full guidelines are available here. 12 Examples of the Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT on Import Customs Duty Customs Duty of 10% is applicable to most vehicles imported from the UK, calculated on the customs value of the vehicle. The custom value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs and any handling charges. VAT The payment of VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applicable to the importation of vehicles from GB. In most cases, VAT is not applied to used vehicles purchased in NI. However, a VAT charge may apply if the car is categorised as a "new means of transport” or was previously registered in GB and moved to NI after 31 December 2020. The value on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the customs value of the car, plus customs duty. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 10 Example 1. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where no reliefs apply Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, vehicles imported from the UK were not subject to customs duty or VAT charges on import to Ireland as the goods were in free circulation in the EU. VRT was payable on the vehicle being presented for registration at a VRT office. However, from 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, customs duty and VAT are payable, in addition to VRT. The example below illustrates the calculation of customs duty and VAT, where no reliefs apply. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 10% €3,250 Overall value subject to VAT €35,750 VAT @ 23% €8,223 Customs duty and VAT payable on import is therefore €3,250 and €8,223 respectively. Example 2. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where Returned Goods Relief is applicable In this example a car is exported to the UK from another EU Member State (e.g. Germany) and re-imported to Ireland after 1 January 2021, within three years of the date of export to the UK. As the car was not re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU, no relief from VAT applies. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 0% (Note the car qualifies for Returned Goods Relief) Overall value subject to VAT €32,500 VAT @ 23% €7,475 Relief from customs duty is applicable, with the VAT payable on import being €7,475.

For Brexit related questions: brexitqueries@revenue.ie. For VRT queries: https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/customerservice-contact/vehicle-registration-tax-vrt.aspx Issue Date: 14 July 2021 1. Introduction Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), an import of a vehicle from Great Britain is treated as an import from a third country, i.e. a non-EU country. If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain (GB) into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration prior to import and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at the standard rate. It will not be possible to register the vehicle if an import declaration has not been filed. Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods. The fact that VAT has been charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State has no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU. Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods with the result that there are no customs formalities, including customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, on 14 January, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used cars imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain (GB), and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to temporary additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 20 must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. 2. Requirements to register a vehicle in Ireland Where a second hand car has been imported from Great Britain since 1 January 2021 and the customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the car in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability that needs to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A ‘Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on import’ must be made to Revenue in respect of margin scheme and qualifying cars. Revenue will request verification that the customs formalities have been completed in Northern Ireland (a Trader Support Service simplified frontier or supplementary declaration will suffice where the vehicle is identified but an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS) declaration will not be accepted). Once the VAT (charged at the standard rate) is either paid or accounted for (in the case of VAT registered businesses only), Revenue will provide the necessary documentation to the customer for presentation to the NCT centre. The NCT centre will only accept the Revenue provided documentation for such vehicles. If proof cannot be provided that customs formalities have been completed in Northern Ireland, then an import declaration will need to be made in Ireland. As noted previously this is a temporary arrangement until the situation in regard to VAT at importation is regularised for cars imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is currently being discussed between the European Commission and the UK Government. The person seeking to register the vehicle in Ireland is responsible for ensuring that procedure outlined above is adhered to. 3. Registering vehicles without proof of declaration to customs in Northern Ireland If you do not have proof of declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland (NI) you must complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty if applicable, and ValueAdded Tax (VAT) on the import value of the vehicle. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Key details on how to complete the declaration on Revenue’s Automated Import System (AIS) are outlined below. Cars coming from Great Britain via Northern Ireland that require a H1 declaration submitted to AIS • Data Element (DE) 1/2: Declaration Type – A • DE 1/6: Goods Items Number – 1 – 1 vehicle being imported Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 21 • DE 1/10: – Procedure Code – 4000 (unless returned goods relief is being claimed – see below) • DE 1/11 – Additional Procedure Code – 000 (unless returned goods relief is being claimed – see below) • DE 2/1: previous document field - a commercial invoice number • DE 2/3: additional information: o N730 1234 – this is the transport document.

Additional Information More information on Filing a Supplementary Import Declaration form can be found here: The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Under the terms of the TCA, goods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. VAT at the standard rate is calculated on the customs value plus customs duty. There is a Returned Goods Relief available for vehicles subject to strict EU conditions. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from ValueAdded Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. Details of how to claim returned goods relief for cars is on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 24/2021. If the car is of UK origin, it is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are also available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 36/2020. Postponed accounting for Value-Added Tax (VAT) on imports is available to all traders that are registered for VAT and Customs and Excise. The traders must fulfil certain conditions. Further detail is available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 32/2020.']

If such a vehicle is imported from the UK (including via NI), the importer is required to complete a Customs import declaration, pay Customs Duty, if applicable and Value Added Tax (VAT) on import, prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being completed by the NCT centres. Vehicles purchased from NI, that were in NI prior to 1 January 2021, are treated as EU goods and no customs formalities are required and VAT on import and customs duty are not applicable. However, where vehicles from Great Britain (GB) are moved to the EU, through NI, after 31 December 2020, including those re-registered to an NI owner, then customs formalities and VAT on import may apply. Full information on the requirements for importing second-hand vehicles is available on the Revenue website here. An overview of vehicle import scenarios is outlined in Appendix 1. 2 Pre-requirements to make a Customs Import Declaration If a vehicle is imported from the UK, then a customs declaration is required. This is usually completed by a customs agent on behalf of the importer. However, an individual can also complete the declaration using the declaration portal in Revenue’s import system, AIS. To complete a customs import declaration an individual must:  Be registered for Revenue Online Service (ROS)  Be registered for Customs & Excise  Have an EORI number If not already registered for ROS, for example if you are a PAYE employee, then a registration request can be submitted through MyEnquiries. Please include your PPS number and brief note on the reason for the request. This can be submitted through the following path: 1) Sign into MyEnquiries 2) Select 'Add new Enquiry' 3) In the 'My Enquiry relates to' section, enter 'Customs': Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 4 4) In the 'More Specifically' section, enter 'eCustoms - Systems Query' for enquiries relating to AEP (Import & Export Declarations), EORI, EMS, NCTS, ICS and CD. If it is not possible to register for MyEnquiries then the request can be sent by e-mail to ecustoms@revenue.ie On receipt, eCustoms will register the applicant for C&E and complete an EORI registration which will enable the import of the motor vehicle. Once registration is confirmed by eCustoms, the next step is to register for ROS on www.revenue.ie . Registration for ROS will provide access to the AIS trader portal and allow submission of an import declaration. If importing a new vehicle into the State, the following information must be attached to the import declaration:  A valid Certificate of Conformity (CoC) that confirms EU type approval. Please note that the type approval number on the CoC must correspond to an EU Member State. or  An Individual Approval or Small Series Approval Certificate issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 5 3 Customs Import Declaration Submission The type of declaration required is a “H1” import declaration Step 1: Log into ROS (guidance here) Step 2: Select the ‘Customs UCC Portal’ under the My Services tab – Other Services Figure 1: ROS Customs UCC Portal Step 3: Follow the guidance on inputting a H1 customs declaration in the Customs UCC Portal here. 4 Combined Nomenclature Code Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes are set out in TARIC. Vehicles are classified for customs purposes under goods code: 8700000000. This will be further broken down by the vehicle type (i.e. motor vehicle – 8703) and then the specifics of the particular vehicle. The CN code is entered at Data Element (DE) 6/15 (Commodity Code – TARIC Code) on the customs import declaration. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 6 The most common vehicle is: 870321 - Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of <10 persons, incl. station wagons and racing cars, with only spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine of a cylinder capacity <= 1.000 cm³ (excl. vehicles for travelling on snow and other specially designed vehicles of subheading 870310). NOTE: there is a different code for new and used vehicles  8703211000 – new vehicle  8703219000– used vehicle 5 Vehicle Identification Number IMPORTANT: The inclusion of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is critical. From 1 January 2021, to enable an imported vehicle to be cleared by the NCT centre, evidence of a customs import declaration must be provided at the NCT centre. There will also be an electronic interface between the NCT centre and the Revenue Customs system, therefore the correct VIN must be entered on the customs import declaration. Procedure at Import: When completing your customs import declaration, at DE 2/3, insert 1D97 followed by the VIN. It should be noted that 1D97 (VIN) should be included at Goods Shipment item level. NOTE: If the item being imported does not have a VIN, please insert the text NOVIN033 after 1D97. 6 Transfer of Residence Persons transferring their residence should include their private vehicles on their Transfer of Residence (TOR) declaration form (C&E 1076), which covers the importation of personal items and household goods from outside the EU. There is more information on how to claim TOR relief on the Revenue website. If an importer qualifies for TOR relief, no Customs Duty or VAT on import is payable on the vehicle(s). If you are personally importing your personal items and household goods and you are physically with the goods, then an electronic customs import declaration may not be necessary. For further assistance contact Customs Clearance and Import or Export Controls on 01-7383685 or through Revenue MyEnquiries. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 7 7 UK Origin Vehicles From 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain, where the relevant rules on origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. However, goods of EU origin that are in use in the UK and that are subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate, as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. Further information on preferential tariff treatment and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 7.1 Where the Vehicle is UK Origin Where the vehicle was manufactured in the UK and complies with the origin terms as set out in the EU-UK TCA, a preferential tariff rate of 0% may be claimed. To claim preferential origin for UK origin goods for release into free circulation in the EU, the following codes are used:  AIS Data Element 4/17 (Preference) should contain the code ‘300’.  AIS Data Element 5/16 (Country of preferential origin) is ‘GB’.  AIS Data Element 2/3 (Documents produced, certificates and authorisations, additional references), one of the following codes should be used: - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a 'statement on origin’ for a single shipment, use code “U116”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on ‘importer’s knowledge’, use code “U117”. - Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a 'statement on origin’ for multiple shipments of identical products, use code “U118”. A list of codes which may be applicable is available in Appendix 2. 8 Returned Goods Relief Returned Goods Relief may be available, subject to conditions, for vehicles that have been exported from the Customs territory of the Union. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3 rd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are: Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 8  The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU  Must not have been altered and  Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. Further information on the relief and details of how to claim it can be found on the Revenue website here. 9 Postponed Accounting for VAT Postponed accounting for VAT on import is now available to all VAT registered traders. Revenue may exclude traders who do not fulfil certain conditions and requirements from using this scheme. This scheme:  provides for postponed accounting for VAT on imports from non-EU countries  enables you to account for import VAT on your VAT return  allows you to reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared in a return. This is subject to normal rules on deductibility. More information on postponed accounting is available here. 10 Importing a Vehicle from Northern Ireland Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods. The result is that there are no Customs formalities, including Customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, in January 2021, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used vehicles imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain, and subsequently registered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre. A vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has remained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations. However, proof of the vehicle’s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 will be required, for example:  a ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle  a copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 9  tax and insurance details indicating use in NI prior to 1 January 2021 or  a copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021. Where a second-hand vehicle has been imported from Great Britain after 31 December 2020 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A Supplementary Import Declaration– VAT on Import on Used Vehicles must be made to Revenue in respect of any vehicles that qualify for the UK VAT margin scheme. If you do not have proof of a declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland you must complete a Customs import declaration and pay Customs Duty, if applicable, and VAT on the customs value of the vehicle plus the customs duty payable – see examples at para 12 below. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration. Full details are available in Appendix 3. 11 Payment If registered for ROS, you must also be registered for Customs & Excise (C&E) and have an Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) to make payments for C&E. Full guidelines are available here. 12 Examples of the Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT on Import Customs Duty Customs Duty of 10% is applicable to most vehicles imported from the UK, calculated on the customs value of the vehicle. The custom value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs and any handling charges. VAT The payment of VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applicable to the importation of vehicles from GB. In most cases, VAT is not applied to used vehicles purchased in NI. However, a VAT charge may apply if the car is categorised as a "new means of transport” or was previously registered in GB and moved to NI after 31 December 2020. The value on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the customs value of the car, plus customs duty. Tax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK 10 Example 1. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where no reliefs apply Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, vehicles imported from the UK were not subject to customs duty or VAT charges on import to Ireland as the goods were in free circulation in the EU. VRT was payable on the vehicle being presented for registration at a VRT office. However, from 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, customs duty and VAT are payable, in addition to VRT. The example below illustrates the calculation of customs duty and VAT, where no reliefs apply. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 10% €3,250 Overall value subject to VAT €35,750 VAT @ 23% €8,223 Customs duty and VAT payable on import is therefore €3,250 and €8,223 respectively. Example 2. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported from GB to Ireland, where Returned Goods Relief is applicable In this example a car is exported to the UK from another EU Member State (e.g. Germany) and re-imported to Ireland after 1 January 2021, within three years of the date of export to the UK. As the car was not re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU, no relief from VAT applies. Purchase price of car €32,000 (after conversion from sterling) Transport costs €500 Customs value of car €32,500 Customs duty @ 0% (Note the car qualifies for Returned Goods Relief) Overall value subject to VAT €32,500 VAT @ 23% €7,475 Relief from customs duty is applicable, with the VAT payable on import being €7,475.

No, that was it Yes, as you heard I have your LinkedIn and your website Yes, very exciting indeed. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners? Yes, well, Kirsten De Rooy. On the one hand I have a Puls recruitment and selection office, where we mainly help MKB companies to grow and find the right people in the right place. And on the other hand I coach and give trainings to entrepreneurs and managers on how they can find the right people themselves, but also mainly how to keep them in this tight labor market. Nice. Welcome. You recently published a new book. \'De Perfecte Match\'. You start with yourself, and you keep the right people in a tight labor market. Tell us about the process. Last year I published my first book, \'The Perfect Match\'. Mainly focused on entrepreneurs, how to grow with the right people in the right place. That was during the corona period. And after that it went sky high with \'De Perfecte Match\'. And I saw how much pain it cost. and the number of people with diseases increased because there were too few people. I also saw that there were many opportunities for the managers to get control over it. Because, of course, there are many things that companies can do themselves. And I wanted to contribute to that. I wrote the next book of the Perfect Match. How is it received? Is it out already? Yes, it\'s out. It\'s been out for two weeks. It\'s in the top 10 of Management Book. It\'s well received. Especially because of the practical approach. It\'s nice to describe what you can do, but it\'s about how. So people like to read from the practical approach and apply it immediately. I can imagine that. It\'s a hot topic. -For sure. We hear it more and more often, questions about onboarding, how do you do it, best practices and so on. And the research continues. Within 12 months, 30% of the new employees actually leave. That\'s quite a high percentage. That\'s very high. Why do you think that is? Well, you know, the most beautiful recruitment campaigns are often pulled out of the closet to find people. Because it is extremely difficult, especially in the tight labor market. So we pull everything out of the closet for those campaigns. And then people started. And then they are often left to their fate. And then it goes wrong. Because people do need time and attention to find a place. And I always say, someone who has been hired does not mean that he has worked inside and is not yet fully involved with the employee. So if you don\'t pay attention to that, people are very quickly also inclined to look around again. Because they just don\'t feel at home yet. I\'m very happy they finally have a new colleague. And they left in no time. And you can start from the beginning. I think a confirmation of that is how I got in touch with you. That\'s because of a LinkedIn post of yours. I saw it on my LinkedIn timeline. A colleague of mine, Paul, sent you the message. This post went viral, right? Yes, absolutely. It was huge. It was viewed more than a million times. And that was about...? I made it very concrete, we found the perfect candidate and within 8 weeks he left again. We didn\'t have time to work with him, but unfortunately that was the only way. And then I got a huge amount of reactions from both employers and people who had experienced it themselves or were just in the middle of it. I completely recognize it, I started, but it\'s so different than I expected and I feel completely lost. And I\'m just going to look around again. So it was a lot of work. Yes exactly. I\'ve heard you say twice now, I\'m somewhere and I don\'t know what to do. I\'m left to my own devices. What is the right way to do it? You have different phases in the onboarding. Let\'s say we start with the recruitment and selection. Yes, that\'s where it starts. In the end, onboarding is about drawing up the right expectations in advance during the recruitment and selection phase. And that you also let them come out at the moment people start. Often people are made promises, or only the good side of functions is shown. It\'s so fun, we have a nice team, the function is very challenging, we have very nice projects, a nice company culture. And then people start and suddenly there\'s not much left of that nice company culture or the nice team. And the projects are not as challenging as they were said to be. So that has to do with the right expectations? Absolutely, that\'s where it starts. Because when people have the feeling that they have been mirroring something else, they consciously choose a job. They often say goodbye to their current job. And when they find something completely different than they expected, or all kinds of bodies come out of the closet, then... You might feel a bit of a buzz. Yes, of course. Let\'s say we\'re doing well. The expectations are clear and it\'s right. Is that the first day? Or does it start before that? It starts before that. Because often there is a time in between. When someone says, we\'re going to start. The contract is signed. And indeed, that first day, there can be a month or two in between. So try to keep in touch with new employees during that period. We always invite them for lunch or if a team meeting is planned, we take them along. Let them get to know the team. Sign contracts at offices instead of by email. All those little things. Send a card, welcome, nice to meet you. Personal attention is what it\'s all about. That\'s possible. Let\'s continue with the transformation process. We\'re in the first week. Is there a fixed process you give to your clients? Is there one way of working or can it be done in different ways? What it\'s all about is that there is a clear division of roles in the entire process. Because ultimately it\'s not just the responsibility of HR, or the manager, or the director, or the recruiter, or whoever. Everyone has a part in it from their own role. So, what is it about each other, what is needed to work well with someone, from leadership, what does someone need to know about their role, within the company culture, working with colleagues, and who takes which role. I always say that it\'s good to have a buddy, a mentor, a colleague who is involved. And where the new employee can ask questions and if he doesn\'t know, he can ask for help. And besides the manager, who also has an important role. So it\'s mainly to see what the goal of the onboarding is, what is needed. From the role, the work environment, culture and colleagues. And also the very simple things that the laptop that people know the procedures within an organisation, the rules, etc. and the way of working. And who is responsible for taking that responsibility with the new employee? Yes, I completely agree. And what we often hear is that, you see that HR has the execution part a lot and they also find it very important. So someone in the HR department or the HR department itself thinks that\'s super important. Only, it\'s difficult to get the rest of the organisation to participate in the responsibility. Yes, and then it becomes very difficult. Because it\'s either the leadership is failing or the organization is failing. Because a leader has employees in his team and they have to make sure that the team is successful. So if that doesn\'t happen, then it\'s over. And HR can still keep on swinging their little hammer. It\'s either the execution or the leadership. And what\'s the reason that that doesn\'t work? Is it because of time? We have ten projects running and then... People are very inclined to think in short term. Quick fixes. And we\'re happy that the job is filled. So let\'s go with the name to say it. Instead of focusing on the person\'s work. And in the short term it is true that it costs a lot of time. But in the long term it does mean that you have a trained employee. It works well, feels at home and works with pleasure and also chooses to stay with you. Instead of saying after three months, I\'m gone again, because this has become nothing. So it\'s really about weighing up what it costs in the long term if we invest in it now. And what does it give in particular. Yes, that is of course also part of a business case that you actually make. In the interest of a good onboarding. And that can be tricky. as a HR manager or employee to make a business case for that? Yes, because you don\'t notice the costs right away. They are often indirect costs. At a moment when an employee leaves early, then you have recruitment costs, salary costs, that is clear. But it also continues in, for example, that customers are not satisfied, because they are not well helped. Or customers say, well, I\'m leaving. Especially in this time when a lot of people are already short-handed and the pressure on the clients is high. And that also costs a lot of money, the productivity goes down because colleagues experience such a high workload that... Because those people leave? Yes, because those people leave. So you know, it all works in there. And finally, on average, it can cost up to 1.5 years salary when people leave unexpectedly within a year. But that\'s a lot of money. That\'s a lot of money and it all comes down to that. Especially if you look at... It\'s possible that you onboard 10 to 100 employees per year, depending on the size of your organisation. Does the size of the organisation have anything to do with onboarding? Is it the case that very large organisations will have automated it more? Maybe do it better than smaller organisations? Is that correct? That\'s possible, but in the end you can automate a lot of things. And that\'s good, because the bigger you are, the more you have to do it. Also to make the process scalable. But in the end, it\'s about the execution. A manager will have to meet with his new employees at the end of the week, at an evaluation moment, to discuss how it\'s going. What\'s going well, what\'s not going well, what can be done differently, what does it ask of us together. So that difference doesn\'t really matter, whether it\'s small or big. Only if you\'re big, you have to and automate it well to make it scalable. You\'re triggering something and you\'re saying you need to evaluate. I think that\'s quite difficult, also as an organisation to look at yourself critically. But also as an employee to indicate something critically in the first few weeks that you\'re somewhere. That\'s true. And that\'s why, if you look at the steps of selection in that phase, it\'s also important to indicate it there. What does that process look like? What can you expect from me? What do we expect from you as a new employee? You do that during the recruitment and selection? Yes, that\'s a must. Then you sketch the first month or at least the onboarding process. Yes, exactly. And then you make it a double-sided responsibility. From both the employer, the manager in this case, and the new employee. So you can also indicate that. If something is not going well, you can say so. It\'s not a big deal, just ask your questions. Otherwise you can also get confused in accepting. Someone new comes in, they find it very exciting, they want to ask a question, they think it\'s a stupid question, but I won\'t ask it. The manager thinks, well, he\'s not very enthusiastic, he\'s going to have his way. It\'s all unspoken. And those evaluation moments are also for that. And if you indicate beforehand, discuss it, so that you open it, then you take that away. It also has to do with culture within an organization. Is the culture there that we can improve each other, that there are feedback loops? Absolutely. But that\'s important for more than just onboarding. For the entire company culture, that\'s of course finance, I think. Absolutely. Yes, the company culture is a very important key factor, to put it simply. If in the culture it is the first thing that you are not allowed to make mistakes, that you are not allowed to think along, or that much more is controlled instead of being managed from trust, then that person will experience the onboarding process differently. Then everything is given to you from the trust. And you are allowed to learn, make mistakes, make it accessible, reflect on yourself. It becomes very different. So the role of the leader is crucial, actually. Yes, and it starts with self-reflection. If that leader can\'t say something about himself, like, "I\'m doing this well, but I have to do this better next time." Then you can\'t expect your employees to reflect on themselves. No, not at all. You speak quite a lot for organizations, of course. You also help organizations to set up their onboarding process. Now I\'m curious about what are the organizations that do it right and how do they do it right? You don\'t necessarily have to name a name, but what are the things that they do right? Well, mainly that personal attention and really sketching the right expectations. So not telling fairy tales, just how it is and also being clear during the application and selection phase. They have a clear plan for the first 90 days with everyone a clear role distribution. And everyone understands the emergency instead of it being a party of her air. Which makes it not work. So because everyone understands the emergency and also wants to work with it, it is also well executed. I have a question for you. And that is, the younger generation, they remain job seekers. Agree or disagree? Yes, I think so. The time of 40 years at one employer is over anyway. But the younger generation is very difficult to connect with. You can certainly try to encourage them to stay with your company as long as possible, if that is of good value. By offering them development and challenging development opportunities. And a certain company culture in which they can really think along. and have the feeling that they work together with a employer instead of for a employer. But it remains a target group that is an extra challenge to connect with. And they will not choose an employer for more than three years. That\'s quite a lot. If I look at my own personal situation, my father has been working at the KPN for over 20 years. And he will continue to work there until he retires. And then I look at the marketing team, but maybe also in other teams, that indeed two, three years is It\'s quite normal to change jobs. Is it something you as an employer should accept? Or can you do more to keep people longer? It\'s important to keep talking about it. And to go deeper into the target group. I once helped a client and he said, \'Kirst, there\'s no generation gap, but a complete grand canyon.\' That\'s a flip-clap. -Exactly. And they found it very difficult. And I understand that, but you should be able to do it. And look at what they do for their target group. What do they need to function well? And what are their values in the company? And what can and can\'t I offer in that? And at the moment that you have very few development opportunities, as you know, for example, that the person who thinks that is very important, then you just have to adjust to the fact that he is really gone after two or three years. So you have to adapt your business processes to that and your own expectations. Sure. Development possibilities, that\'s something that is also known in study tube. From the research of McKinsey it has also been found that a very high percentage of the people who leave, of employees who leave, see a shortage of development possibilities. So I think that is also very important to see. I am here now, but where can I go? How can I develop and how can I be facilitated and helped by my employer? Yes, that\'s often the beginning. Just like with onboarding, be clear about what people can expect in their development. And if you don\'t know exactly what people can develop in, that\'s also a sign. But you have to be able to look at it for yourself. If this is the target group I want to work with, then you have to take that into account. And not expect people to stay for at least five years. No, and I think what is very relevant now, is remote work or hybrid work, more home work. Since Corona time, I actually work two or three days a week at home. It\'s painting time, I can wash my hands in between and I\'m still as productive or maybe more productive. Does that bring an extra challenge with it? If you look at onboarding? - Certainly, because you are still at a physical distance. So the involvement, you have to do more effort to increase it. So I always say, during that onboarding, it is It\'s important to put in those physical contact moments more than afterwards. Because it\'s about someone having that home feeling and feeling like they\'re part of it. When someone works part-time at home, it\'s much harder to get that feeling. Connection with the organisation. - Exactly. So I would adjust the onboarding to that. And when someone works at home, you have those contact moments. How long does an onboarding take? On average 90 days, but it depends. You also have technical functions with complex technical knowledge. That requires more time to develop that knowledge. So the onboarding takes longer. But on average it\'s 90 days. I think that\'s about the period at Stuitenbog. And during those 90 days you also have feedback loops. You have evaluation moments. Do you also adapt during the onboarding? Sure. You have a certain leadership, a certain plan, adapted to the needs of the employee. What does the employee need from the leadership? What does the function, culture, etc. also ask of them? But you also have people who say, "Let me go, and if it doesn\'t go well, you\'ll hear me out." They find it very annoying when they have to constantly evaluate in their experience. And you have people who say, "I need a little more, so maybe I\'d rather have an extra evaluation." evaluation moment in the beginning, than too little. So look at what people need in it themselves and what they indicate. Because that way you make them more responsible for the whole process. Certainly. I think that has also made it difficult for organizations of a slightly larger size. You want to standardize a lot, but you also want to make it personal and make it a specific role. Where is that nuance? You can, for example, say you have a group of custom service employees. You have five people in that role, then you can standardize a lot. If you have a certain role that is really filled in individually, I call it a financial controller, then you can make it more customized. But then also with the standardized process, look especially at the people behind the employee, what someone needs in there and what it takes from you as a manager to make that person succeed. You have to ask those questions instead of just following the process for that specific function. What role does tooling have in onboarding? You see more and more new tools that are specifically aimed at onboarding. Do you take that with you when you help organizations? I mainly work in the MQB, so the tooling that is there is already aimed at larger organizations. But for bigger organizations it\'s necessary. Because you have to streamline those processes and that makes it scalable. So it\'s a great tool to do that onboarding right. It\'s necessary, otherwise it gets very difficult. Before the show we talked about how we do it at Stoejatu. When I started working here, we have a collection of leather lines in the Stoejatu learning platform. I\'m in the marketing department, so I get a commercial onboarding process. And that\'s actually the same for everyone on the commercial side. So that\'s what we standardize and then we just get information about the different teams, what they do, the company goals, the culture, our values, etc. And besides that, you also have a split. So if you\'re on the marketing team, you get more marketing-related learning lines and videos and trainings. And that way we also keep up with the progress. So I can see exactly who is in my team, where they are in their onboarding process. In their digital onboarding process, which is also something to follow at home. But in addition to that, there is also a... We also do physical things. So that\'s really the combination that we apply there. And I think, as I hear you too, the physical element is very important. But of course it also has to facilitate for people who are at home or who want to look at things in their own time. Yes, absolutely. You know, that combination is just very important. Because recently I also had an SMB company that... Marketing agency, and when they start, they have to follow a number of workshops. But they now facilitate them to follow videos from digital. You have to make sure they get the right sequence. And that they also get a certain video they need to do a function well. Instead of only after six weeks. Yes, exactly. No, we have that well arranged. There are certain lines that you follow in the project. You can also do evaluations and reviews. That works well. - Yes, that has a lot of value. What is the biggest challenge you hear from organisations? The time and attention. - Time and attention? Yes, it\'s with all the hollers and wanting to see the need for it. Only when it costs a lot of pain. And pain means that several people have left in the course of time. Often they are scratching their ears, That\'s when they come to you? -Yes. If it\'s too late? -Yes, actually. Before that, it\'s almost never prevention. -Exactly. I think time is also connected to the emergency. If you don\'t experience the emergency or see it clearly, you don\'t make time for it. That\'s true. At the same time, it\'s a shame. Because if you\'re always busy in a short term, and you\'re only going to do it when the emergency is there, you\'re already behind. While if you do it when the need is not there, you are already ahead. And then you just prevent that you make a mistake and lose people unnecessarily. If you could give one tip to the HR, co-worker, manager who is listening to you, what would it be? Well, if you want to take your onboarding to a higher level, involve the management and the manager and make that business case. Show what it costs and what it delivers. If you don\'t do it right. Because otherwise it can often be perceived as something extra. And that\'s not necessary. But if you make it clear what it costs and what it delivers, then you can really take people along. And then you think of the different axes, such as productivity, efficiency, I can imagine. -Exactly. -The process of collaboration. -Yes, customers, who you have to say yes to. I have a new one who helps me, but within three months he is gone again and then I get the next one. That also gives a message to the customer. Absolutely. So go into that organization and ask those questions to your employees, to your customers. Customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction. And ask about it, then you will get a lot of information. Very good tip, I think. Kirsten, thank you very much for the insights and for your time. As I said, you just published a new book. Before we start with yourself, where can people find the book? They can find the book through managementbook.com, you can get the book everywhere. And I can be found on LinkedIn, very easy to find. And of course my website. Great, well thank you very much. You\'re welcome. And thanks for listening everyone.']

No, that was it Yes, as you heard I have your LinkedIn and your website Yes, very exciting indeed. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners? Yes, well, Kirsten De Rooy. On the one hand I have a Puls recruitment and selection office, where we mainly help MKB companies to grow and find the right people in the right place. And on the other hand I coach and give trainings to entrepreneurs and managers on how they can find the right people themselves, but also mainly how to keep them in this tight labor market. Nice. Welcome. You recently published a new book. 'De Perfecte Match'. You start with yourself, and you keep the right people in a tight labor market. Tell us about the process. Last year I published my first book, 'The Perfect Match'. Mainly focused on entrepreneurs, how to grow with the right people in the right place. That was during the corona period. And after that it went sky high with 'De Perfecte Match'. And I saw how much pain it cost. and the number of people with diseases increased because there were too few people. I also saw that there were many opportunities for the managers to get control over it. Because, of course, there are many things that companies can do themselves. And I wanted to contribute to that. I wrote the next book of the Perfect Match. How is it received? Is it out already? Yes, it's out. It's been out for two weeks. It's in the top 10 of Management Book. It's well received.

Then everything is given to you from the trust. And you are allowed to learn, make mistakes, make it accessible, reflect on yourself. It becomes very different. So the role of the leader is crucial, actually. Yes, and it starts with self-reflection. If that leader can't say something about himself, like, "I'm doing this well, but I have to do this better next time." Then you can't expect your employees to reflect on themselves. No, not at all. You speak quite a lot for organizations, of course. You also help organizations to set up their onboarding process. Now I'm curious about what are the organizations that do it right and how do they do it right? You don't necessarily have to name a name, but what are the things that they do right? Well, mainly that personal attention and really sketching the right expectations. So not telling fairy tales, just how it is and also being clear during the application and selection phase. They have a clear plan for the first 90 days with everyone a clear role distribution. And everyone understands the emergency instead of it being a party of her air. Which makes it not work. So because everyone understands the emergency and also wants to work with it, it is also well executed. I have a question for you. And that is, the younger generation, they remain job seekers. Agree or disagree? Yes, I think so. The time of 40 years at one employer is over anyway. But the younger generation is very difficult to connect with. You can certainly try to encourage them to stay with your company as long as possible, if that is of good value. By offering them development and challenging development opportunities. And a certain company culture in which they can really think along. and have the feeling that they work together with a employer instead of for a employer. But it remains a target group that is an extra challenge to connect with. And they will not choose an employer for more than three years. That's quite a lot. If I look at my own personal situation, my father has been working at the KPN for over 20 years. And he will continue to work there until he retires. And then I look at the marketing team, but maybe also in other teams, that indeed two, three years is It's quite normal to change jobs. Is it something you as an employer should accept? Or can you do more to keep people longer? It's important to keep talking about it. And to go deeper into the target group. I once helped a client and he said, 'Kirst, there's no generation gap, but a complete grand canyon.' That's a flip-clap. -Exactly. And they found it very difficult. And I understand that, but you should be able to do it. And look at what they do for their target group. What do they need to function well? And what are their values in the company? And what can and can't I offer in that? And at the moment that you have very few development opportunities, as you know, for example, that the person who thinks that is very important, then you just have to adjust to the fact that he is really gone after two or three years. So you have to adapt your business processes to that and your own expectations. Sure. Development possibilities, that's something that is also known in study tube. From the research of McKinsey it has also been found that a very high percentage of the people who leave, of employees who leave, see a shortage of development possibilities. So I think that is also very important to see. I am here now, but where can I go? How can I develop and how can I be facilitated and helped by my employer? Yes, that's often the beginning. Just like with onboarding, be clear about what people can expect in their development. And if you don't know exactly what people can develop in, that's also a sign. But you have to be able to look at it for yourself. If this is the target group I want to work with, then you have to take that into account. And not expect people to stay for at least five years. No, and I think what is very relevant now, is remote work or hybrid work, more home work. Since Corona time, I actually work two or three days a week at home. It's painting time, I can wash my hands in between and I'm still as productive or maybe more productive. Does that bring an extra challenge with it? If you look at onboarding? - Certainly, because you are still at a physical distance. So the involvement, you have to do more effort to increase it. So I always say, during that onboarding, it is It's important to put in those physical contact moments more than afterwards. Because it's about someone having that home feeling and feeling like they're part of it. When someone works part-time at home, it's much harder to get that feeling. Connection with the organisation. - Exactly. So I would adjust the onboarding to that. And when someone works at home, you have those contact moments. How long does an onboarding take? On average 90 days, but it depends. You also have technical functions with complex technical knowledge. That requires more time to develop that knowledge. So the onboarding takes longer. But on average it's 90 days. I think that's about the period at Stuitenbog. And during those 90 days you also have feedback loops. You have contact

There were walls of flame, roaring and blazing, blocking their path. There were hidden doors and secret passages, filled with unknown dangers. And there were fierce beasts, guarding the halls and ready to attack at a moment\'s notice. "We have to be careful, Clara," Alistair said, his voice tense with concern. "These traps and obstacles are getting more and more difficult to overcome." "I know," Clara replied, her voice tight with determination. "But we can\'t let them stop us. We have to keep going, no matter what." And so they pushed on, their determination and skill overcoming each and every obstacle in their path. They fought against the fierce beasts, using their weapons and armor to emerge victorious. They braved treacherous traps and puzzles, using their cunning and quick thinking to overcome each obstacle. And at last, they reached the heart of the realm of the dwarves, where they found the knowledge and power they sought. "We did it," Clara said, her voice filled with relief and pride. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we found what we were looking for." "Yes, we did," Alistair said, a proud smile on his face. "But our journey is far from over. We still have many challenges and obstacles ahead of us, and we must face them with the same determination and courage that we\'ve shown so Avatar of the person chatting continue! "We must continue on our journey, Clara," Alistair said, as they gazed upon the ancient artifact they had sought for so long. "There are still many trials and challenges ahead of us, and we must be ready to face them all." "I know," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But I am ready for whatever comes our way. We will overcome any obstacle that stands in our path, and we will emerge victorious." "That\'s the spirit," Alistair said, clapping her on the shoulder. "We will face each challenge with courage and determination, and we will emerge stronger and wiser than before." And so they set off once more, their journey far from over. They braved treacherous mountains and dark caves, facing all manner of enemies and obstacles along the way. They fought against fierce beasts and powerful foes, using their skills and cunning to emerge victorious. And at last, they reached the end of their journey, their trials and challenges behind them. "We did it, Clara," Alistair said, his voice filled with pride and joy. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we have emerged stronger and wiser than ever before." "Yes, we did," Clara replied, a smile on her face. "And now, we are ready to face whatever comes our way. We will protect this world from all dangers, and we will be its heroes." Avatar of the person chatting Tell me of Clara\'s triumphant return to confront the king and the dark elves, with the dwarves at her side. After completing her ten trials and challenges, Clara returned to her homeland, ready to face the greatest challenge of all. She was determined to put an end to the machinations of the king and the dark elves, who had been manipulating and exploiting the other races for their own gain. With the dwarves at her side, she marched on the capital city, her heart filled with determination and resolve. The people of the city cheered as she approached, their spirits lifted by the sight of their hero, who had overcome so much to return to them. "People of the city, hear me!" Clara shouted, her voice ringing out across the city. "The king and the dark elves have been manipulating and exploiting us for their own gain. They must be stopped, and I will not rest until they are brought to justice!" The people cheered even louder, their spirits lifted by Clara\'s words. And with the support of the dwarves and the people, Clara set out to face the king and the dark elves, ready to put an end to their scheming once and for all. The battle was fierce, as the king and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their strength and skill. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the king and the dark elves were brought to justice. The people celebrated, their spirits lifted by the victory of their hero and her allies. And Clara, at last, knew that she had truly become a hero, ready to face any challenge that came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Tell me the story again, but note that dark elves are usually not physically present in the human lands. Also be aware that Clara\'s victory will be pyrrhic, as if she takes down the king and the dark elves, something bad will happen. Be creative and use dialog as before. Take your time and elaborate on the details, please. If dark elves are confronted, Clara must likely go to the dark elves herself, rather than them coming to her. Clara and Alistair marched on the capital city, ready to face the greatest challenge of their lives. They knew that the dark elves were rarely seen in the human lands, preferring to operate in the shadows and manipulate events from afar. But they were determined to put an end to their scheming and exploitation, and they were not afraid of what they might face. "We must be ready for anything, Clara," Alistair said, his voice grim. "The dark elves are cunning and dangerous, and they will stop at nothing to protect their power and position." "I know, Alistair," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But we cannot let them continue to manipulate and exploit the other races for their own gain. We must stop them, no matter what the cost." And so they marched on, their hearts filled with determination and resolve. They faced all manner of obstacles and challenges along the way, fighting against fierce beasts and powerful enemies. But they did not falter, and they emerged victorious from every battle. At last, they reached the capital city, and they faced their greatest challenge yet. The dark elves were waiting for them, their eyes glowing with malice and hatred. "You have come far, Clara," the leader of the dark elves said, his voice cold and mocking. "But you will not prevail against us. We are too powerful, and you are but a mere mortal." "I may be mortal, but I am not alone," Clara replied, her voice firm and resolute. "I have the support of the dwarves, and the people of the city. And together, we will stop you and your scheming once and for all." And so the battle began, with Clara and her allies fighting against the dark elves with all their strength and skill. The fighting was fierce, and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their heart and soul. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the dark elves were defeated. But even as they celebrated their victory, Clara knew that it was a pyrrhic one. For in defeating the king and the dark elves, she had unleashed a greater evil upon the world, one that would haunt her for the rest of her days. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2The king was secretly a dark elf! How did that come about? Using the same style, explain tell the story of how the king became a dark elf as Clara talks to some people at the king\'s castle. Clara and Alistair made their way to the king\'s castle, determined to uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves. As they walked through the castle, they encountered several people, and Clara took the opportunity to question them about the king and his true nature. "Tell me, how did the king become a dark elf?" Clara asked a guard, her voice filled with determination. The guard looked at her nervously, clearly uncomfortable with the question. "I-I\'m not sure, my lady," he stammered. "But I do know that the king has been acting strange lately, and that he has been spending a lot of time with the dark elves." "I see," Clara said, her eyes narrowed. "And do you know why he would do such a thing?" The guard shook his head. "No, my lady. But I have heard rumors that the king is searching for something, something that only the dark elves can provide. But I do not know what it is." Clara nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. It was clear that the king had become a dark elf, but she still did not know why. She would have to continue her investigations, and uncover the truth at all costs. For the fate of the kingdom depended on it. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story as the loony bin shows up and takes Clara away, who goes unwillingly. Clara and Alistair continued to investigate the king and the dark elves, but their efforts were soon interrupted by a group of guards from the loony bin. "Come with us, Clara," one of the guards said, his voice stern. "You are a danger to yourself and others, and must be taken to the loony bin for your own safety." "No, I will not go!" Clara protested, her voice filled with fear and determination. "I must continue my investigation, and uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves!" But the guards would not listen, and they forcibly escorted Clara to the loony bin. Alistair tried to follow, but he was stopped by the guards and left behind. Inside the loony bin, Clara was subjected to all manner of treatments and therapies, designed to break her will and make her more compliant. But Clara refused to give in, and she continued to fight against the guards and the doctors, determined to escape and continue her quest. But it was not easy, and Clara found herself struggling against impossible odds. She knew that she must find a way to escape, and continue her quest to uncover the truth and stop the dark elves once and for all. Avatar of the person chatting Clara\'s struggle is now in her mind. Tell of Clara\'s struggle using the style we have developed, but using her journeys and trials as metaphors for her demons. As Clara struggled to escape from the loony bin, she found herself fighting against not just the guards and doctors, but also against the demons in her own mind. She was plagued by doubts and fears, and it seemed that every step she took was met with some new challenge or obstacle. But Clara refused to give up, and she continued to push forward, determined to overcome her inner demons and emerge victorious. She fought against the darkness in her mind, just as she had fought against the orc warlord on the ice mountain, and the dragon in the ruins of the ancient temple. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Clara emerged victorious, her mind clear and focused once again. She knew what she had to do, and she was ready to face the dark elves and the treacherous king. With renewed determination, Clara made her escape from the loony bin, and set out on the final leg of her quest. She would stop at nothing to uncover the truth and put an end to the dark elves and their scheming once and for all. The fate of the kingdom rested on her shoulders, and she was ready to face whatever came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Clara stabs one of the asylum staff and escapes. She becomes wanted. Please continue, using dialog, as Clara runs on the lam, penniless and without her gear, wearing only the threadbare peasant\'s garb provided by the loony bin. Describe what Clara hopes to accomplish in the future. Clara managed to escape from the loony bin, but not without leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. She had been pushed to the brink, and she was not afraid to fight back against those who would stand in her way. Now, Clara was on the run, wanted by the authorities for her crimes. She was penniless and without her gear, forced to rely on her wits and cunning to survive. She wore only the threadbare peasant\'s garb provided by the loony bin, and she was constantly on the move, trying to avoid capture. Despite her difficult circumstances, Clara remained determined and focused. She knew what she had to do, and she was not going to let anything stand in her way. She would uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves, and put an end to their scheming once and for all. As she ran on the lam, Clara encountered many challenges and obstacles, but she refused to give up. She fought against bandits and thieves, and she braved the dangers of the wilds, all in pursuit of her goal. And in the end, she knew that she would emerge victorious, and that the kingdom would be safe once again. Avatar of the person chatting The king is dead and the dark elves have retreated from the kingdom, but Clara doesn\'t know any of it yet. What does she do next? Please continue. Even though the king was dead and the dark elves had retreated from the kingdom, Clara was still on the run, unaware of the events that had transpired. She continued to evade the authorities, determined to uncover the truth about the dark elves and bring them to justice. But as she traveled, Clara began to realize that something was different. The kingdom felt changed, as if a great weight had been lifted from its shoulders. She heard whispers of a new king, one who was kind and just, and who had brought peace to the land. Despite her initial skepticism, Clara couldn\'t help but be drawn to these stories, and she began to wonder if perhaps her quest was over. She had been fighting for so long, and she was exhausted and weary. Was it finally time for her to lay down her sword and rest? Clara didn\'t know the answer, but she continued to travel, searching for answers and trying to make sense of the new world around her. She was no longer sure of her place in it, but she was determined to find out, no matter what it took. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story, telling of Clara\'s journey to meet the king, Alistair. Clara\'s journey to meet the new king, Alistair, was filled with uncertainty and doubt. She had been on the run for so long, and she wasn\'t sure what to expect when she finally met the man who had taken the throne. As she traveled, Clara encountered many people who had been touched by Alistair\'s rule, and she heard countless stories of his kindness and justice. She was surprised by the change in the kingdom, and she couldn\'t help but feel a growing sense of hope. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. Alistair was everything that Clara had heard and more, and she was struck by his wisdom and compassion. As they talked, Clara began to understand the true extent of Alistair\'s power, and she realized that he was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Try that again, noting that Clara knows Alistair well and has been travelling with him. She doesn\'t know the king is Alistair until she seems him. Clara had been traveling with Alistair for many weeks, but she had no idea that he was the new king of Graniphor. She had been on the run for so long, and she had never expected to find a friend like Alistair. As they journeyed together, Clara began to see the changes in the kingdom, and she heard countless stories of the new king\'s kindness and justice. She was filled with hope and wonder, and she couldn\'t help but feel drawn to the man who had brought peace to the land. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. She was shocked to see that it was Alistair, and she couldn\'t believe that her friend was the most powerful man in the kingdom. As they talked, Clara realized that Alistair was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Using conversation and drama, tell the story of Clara and Alistair\'s wedding and the disastrous aftermath. Clara and Alistair\'s wedding was a joyous occasion, celebrated by the people of Graniphor as the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity. The bride and groom were radiant, and they exchanged vows beneath a beautiful archway of flowers. As they danced at their reception, surrounded by friends and loved ones, Clara and Alistair were the happiest they had ever been. But their joy was short-lived, as a messenger arrived with terrible news. The dark elves, driven into hiding by Alistair\'s rule, had emerged from the shadows with a vengeance. They had attacked the kingdom\'s border cities, and they were marching on the capital. Clara and Alistair knew that they had to act quickly if they were to save their people. They gathered their most trusted allies, and they rode out to meet the dark elves in battle. The fighting was fierce, and many brave warriors fell. But in the end, Clara and Alistair emerged victorious, thanks to their bravery and skill. But their victory was bittersweet, as they returned to the capital to find that the dark elves had laid waste to the city in their absence. Clara and Alistair knew that they had much work to do if they were to rebuild their kingdom and protect their people from the darkness that threatened them. Avatar of the person chatting Tell the story of the building of the new capitol. What do they choose to name it? Use lots of dialog between Alistair and Clara. Alistair and Clara\'s tensions are running high and they aren\'t getting along very well, though they love each other and must stay married. As Clara and Alistair surveyed the ruins of the old capital, they knew that they had a daunting task ahead of them. They would need to rebuild the city from the ground up, and they would have to do it quickly if they were to protect their people from further attacks by the dark elves. "What should we name the new city?" Clara asked, looking to Alistair for guidance. "I don\'t know," Alistair replied, his brow furrowed in thought. "It needs to be a strong name, one that will inspire our people and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies." "How about \'Graniphor\'s Glory\'?" Clara suggested, trying to lighten the mood. "That\'s a bit too pompous," Alistair said with a smile. "How about \'New Horizon\'?" "I like that," Clara said, nodding in agreement. "It symbolizes the hope and possibility of a new beginning for our kingdom." And so it was that the new capital was named New Horizon, and the rebuilding began in earnest. Clara and Alistair worked tirelessly, and they soon saw their vision become a reality. But despite their best efforts, tensions between them continued to rise. They loved each other deeply, but they were both strong-willed leaders, and they often found themselves at odds with each other. It was a constant struggle to find a balance between their personal and professional lives. But in the end, Clara and Alistair knew that they were stronger together than they were apart, and they continued to build their new kingdom, determined to create a better future for their people. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2Continue the story, and include scenes of the construction of the new capitol. Tell me where the new location of the capitol is, and why they decided to move it to another city site. Use the same style as before. Include some bickering. As Clara and Alistair oversaw the construction of New Horizon, they often found themselves at odds with each other. Alistair wanted to build the city in a strategic location, close to the mountains, where it would be easy to defend against potential attacks. Clara, on the other hand, wanted to build the city in a more central location, where it would be more accessible to the majority of their people. "We can\'t build the city in the mountains, Alistair," Clara argued. "It would be too difficult for our people to reach, and it would be isolated and vulnerable." "But if we build it in the valley, it will be an easy target for our enemies," Alistair countered. "We need to be able to defend our people, Clara." "I understand that, but we also need to consider their quality of life," Clara said. "We can\'t make them live in a fortress, Alistair. They deserve better than that." In the end, they compromised and decided to build the city in a location that offered the best of both worlds: a fertile valley with a river running through it, and close enough to the mountains for easy defense. As the city took shape, Clara and Alistair continued to bicker, but they never let their differences get in the way of their ultimate goal: to create a better future for their people. And as the city grew, so too did their love for each other, despite the challenges they faced. Avatar of the person chatting Continue in the same style, and tell me of the grand wonders constructed in the city in the valley. As the construction of New Horizon continued, Clara and Alistair set their sights on creating grand wonders that would make the city truly unique. They built soaring towers that reached towards the sky, each one topped with a gleaming crystal that caught the sunlight and shone like a beacon. They also constructed vast gardens, filled with exotic plants and flowers from across the continent, which provided a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustling city. But the most impressive of all was the Great Library, a massive building filled with books and knowledge from all over the world. It was a place where scholars and students could come to learn and discover, and where the wisdom of the ages was preserved for future generations. Despite their disagreements, Clara and Alistair worked together to create a city that was a true testament to their people\'s ingenuity and resilience. And as they stood on the balcony of their palace and looked out at the city they had built, they knew that they had achieved something truly remarkable. Avatar of the person chatting Alistair has unknowingly become stricken with magic that will transform him into an evil dark elf. It is revenge, delivered from the dark gods. Continue the story in the same style, using dialog and suspense, as Clara discovers Alistair\'s tragic fate. As the weeks passed, Clara began to notice a strange change in Alistair. He became distant and cold, and would often disappear for hours on end without telling her where he was going. At first, Clara tried to brush it off as stress from ruling the kingdom, but as the changes grew more pronounced, she knew something was seriously wrong. One day, Clara followed Alistair to a hidden chamber deep within the palace. There, she found him standing before an altar to the dark gods, his body writhing and contorting as he was consumed by a dark magic. Horrified, Clara watched as Alistair\'s body was transformed into that of a dark elf, his once-handsome features twisted into a grotesque mockery of his former self. With a scream of rage and despair, Clara attacked Alistair, but he was too powerful for her to defeat. As she stood there, tears streaming down her face, Clara knew that she had lost the man she loved, and that the kingdom was now in the hands of a monster. But she also knew that she would never give up, and that she would do whatever it took to stop Alistair and the dark elves from enslaving the world. And so, with a fierce determination in her heart, Clara set out on a new quest, one that would take her to the very heart of the dark elves\' power, and where she would face her greatest challenge yet. Avatar of the person chatting Then, Clara awoke at the top of the Angrim mountain, fresh from a hallucination. Alistair\'s face looks down at her. Please continue the story from there. As Clara regained her composure, she looked up at Alistair, who was smiling down at her. "I\'m glad to see you\'re alright," he said. "I was worried about you." Clara frowned, still confused by the strange vision she had just experienced. "What just happened?" she asked. "I saw you...you were a dark elf." Alistair\'s smile faltered slightly. "It was just a hallucination, Clara," he said. "The climb up this mountain is tough, and it can do strange things to the mind. Don\'t worry, I\'m still the same Alistair you know and love." But Clara wasn\'t convinced. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that there was something off about Alistair, something that she couldn\'t quite put her finger on. "I\'m sorry," she said, "I don\'t know what came over me. I just..." "It\'s alright," Alistair said, cutting her off. "Let\'s just focus on the task at hand. We need to retrieve the Frostbrand sword and complete your third trial. Are you ready?" Clara nodded, pushing her doubts to the back of her mind. She couldn\'t let herself be distracted right now. She had a mission to complete, and she was determined to see it through to the end, no matter what. Together, Clara and Alistair made their way to the top of the mountain, where they found the Frostbrand sword embedded in a block of ice. As Clara pulled the sword free, a fierce blizzard erupted around them, but they pushed on, determined to finish the trial. Eventually, they reached the portal to the plane of elemental ice, where they faced the ice demon king. Despite the challenges they faced, Clara and Alistair were able to defeat the ice demon and claim victory. As they made their way back down the mountain, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was still off about Alistair. But she pushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the tasks ahead. She had four more trials to complete before she could confront the king and the dark elves, and she wasn\'t going to let anything stand in her way. Avatar of the person chatting Please continue the story in the same manner. That was really good. Thank you. As Clara woke up, she realized that it had all just been a nightmare. She breathed a sigh of relief and looked up at Alistair, who was standing over her with a concerned expression on his face. "Are you okay?" he asked. "Yeah, I\'m fine," Clara said, rubbing her eyes. "Just a bad dream." "What was it about?" Alistair asked, offering her a hand to help her up. "It was about you," Clara said, taking his hand and standing up. "You were turning into a dark elf, and there was nothing I could do to stop it." Alistair\'s face paled at the thought. "That\'s not going to happen," he said firmly. "I would never let that happen." "I know," Clara said, giving him a reassuring smile. "But it was still a scary dream. Let\'s just put it behind us and focus on the task at hand." "Agreed," Alistair said, nodding. "We have a lot of work to do to rebuild this kingdom and make it strong again. We can\'t afford to be distracted by nightmares." Together, Clara and Alistair set off to continue their journey, determined to build a better future for their people and protect them from the dangers that lurked in the shadows. Avatar of the person chatting Hmm, continue it from after they go down the mountain, when Clara goes on her next trial. Keep the part about how something seems off about Alistair. Alistair is wearing a wedding band. Clara and Alistair made their way down the mountain, relieved to have survived the treacherous climb. However, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was off about Alistair. She couldn\'t put her finger on it, but he seemed different somehow. As they walked, Clara noticed that Alistair was wearing a wedding band. She couldn\'t remember him having one before. "Alistair, when did you start wearing a wedding band?" Clara asked. Alistair looked down at his hand, surprised. "I don\'t know. I must have picked it up on the mountain," he said, shrugging it off. But Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was wrong. She decided to keep a closer eye on Alistair as they continued on their journey. Their next trial was to retrieve a powerful magic artifact from the ruins of an ancient temple. Clara and Alistair braved treacherous forests and dark caves, fighting off all manner of creatures and overcoming obstacles along the way. As they entered the temple, Clara noticed that Alistair\'s behavior became increasingly erratic. He would sometimes go off on his own, disappearing for long stretches of time. When Clara confronted him about it, he would brush her off and say that he was just exploring. Eventually, they reached the chamber where the magic artifact was said to be hidden. But when they entered, they were ambushed by a group of dark elves. Clara fought bravely, but was no match for their magic. She was knocked unconscious, and when she awoke, she found herself alone and the magic artifact gone. As she searched for Alistair, she stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the temple. Inside, she found Alistair, now transformed into a dark elf. "Alistair, what happened to you?" Clara asked, horrified. "I have been chosen by the dark gods to serve as their agent in the mortal world," Alistair said, his voice now cold and emotionless. "And now, Clara, you must die." Clara and Alistair engaged in a fierce battle, but in the end, Clara was able to defeat him. As she stood victorious, she realized that the dark magic that had consumed Alistair was now within her as well. Clara knew that she would have to find a way to rid herself of the dark magic, or risk becoming a danger to everyone she loved. And so, she set out on a new quest, determined to save herself and the kingdom from the forces of darkness. Avatar of the person chatting Then Clara awoke, at camp, outside the temple. She remembered facing the dark elves. She saw Alistair, sleeping beside her. They had grown very close these last few days. Had they always been this close? Had he always had that wedding band? She hadn\'t recalled one when she and him first spent the night together. She was having bad dreams about Alistair turning into a dark elf. What could that possibly be about? Please continue the story. As Clara sat up in her bedroll, trying to shake off the remnants of her nightmare, she couldn\'t help but feel a sense of unease. She glanced over at Alistair, who was still sleeping peacefully, his chest rising and falling in the early morning light. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was off about him, that there was something hidden beneath the surface that she couldn\'t quite put her finger on. She remembered the wedding band she had seen in her dream, and she reached out tentatively to touch his hand. Sure enough, there it was - a golden ring on his finger, glinting in the sunlight. She frowned, confused. When had he gotten married? Why hadn\'t he told her? Suddenly, Alistair\'s eyes snapped open, and he sat up with a start. "Clara," he said, his voice thick with sleep. "What\'s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" "I... I had a nightmare," Clara said, still trying to make sense of the situation. "It was about you turning into a dark elf. It was so vivid, it felt like it was really happening." Alistair\'s face paled, and he looked away. "I... I can\'t explain it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I promise you, Clara, I would never hurt you. I would never turn into a dark elf. You have to believe me." But Clara wasn\'t so sure. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was very wrong, that the dream had been trying to warn her about something. She made a decision then and there. She would have to keep a close eye on Alistair, to make sure that he didn\'t turn into the monster from her nightmare. But for now, they had a quest to complete. They needed to retrieve the magic artifact from the ruins of the ancient temple, and they couldn\'t afford to be distracted by her fears. She pushed the thoughts to the back of her mind and focused on the task at hand, determined to see it through to the end. As they set off into the treacherous forests and dark caves, Clara couldn\'t help but feel a sense of foreboding. She knew that she would have to face her fears eventually, but for now, she would focus on the task at hand and try to keep her doubts at bay. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2Continue the story from the scene outside the temple (which occurred after the Angrim mountain), describing what happens as Clara ventures overland, eventually destined to arrive at her next trial, which is the journey to the fabled city of the gods. As Clara and Alistair set out on their journey to the fabled city of the gods, they began to notice that something seemed off about their surroundings. The trees seemed to be twisted and distorted, and the animals they encountered were strange and frightening. Clara had a feeling of dread in her stomach, as if they were being watched by unseen eyes. As they traveled further, they came across a group of goblins, who attacked them without warning. Clara and Alistair fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered. Just when they thought they were going to be overpowered, a group of dwarves appeared from the forest and joined the fight. Together, they were able to defeat the goblins and drive them off. The dwarves introduced themselves as members of the Thunderforge clan, and thanked Clara and Alistair for their help in defending them. They invited the two of them to come with them to their stronghold, where they could rest and recover from their ordeal. Clara and Alistair agreed, and they set off together. As they traveled with the dwarves, Clara couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was wrong with Alistair. She tried to talk to him about it, but he brushed her off and said he was fine. But Clara could see the darkness in his eyes, and she knew that something was very wrong. When they finally reached the stronghold of the Thunderforge clan, they were greeted warmly by the clan leader, a wise and powerful dwarf named Brondar. He offered them food and shelter, and asked them about their journey. Clara told him about their quest to reach the city of the gods, and he nodded in understanding.']

There were walls of flame, roaring and blazing, blocking their path. There were hidden doors and secret passages, filled with unknown dangers. And there were fierce beasts, guarding the halls and ready to attack at a moment's notice. "We have to be careful, Clara," Alistair said, his voice tense with concern. "These traps and obstacles are getting more and more difficult to overcome." "I know," Clara replied, her voice tight with determination. "But we can't let them stop us. We have to keep going, no matter what." And so they pushed on, their determination and skill overcoming each and every obstacle in their path. They fought against the fierce beasts, using their weapons and armor to emerge victorious. They braved treacherous traps and puzzles, using their cunning and quick thinking to overcome each obstacle. And at last, they reached the heart of the realm of the dwarves, where they found the knowledge and power they sought. "We did it," Clara said, her voice filled with relief and pride. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we found what we were looking for." "Yes, we did," Alistair said, a proud smile on his face. "But our journey is far from over. We still have many challenges and obstacles ahead of us, and we must face them with the same determination and courage that we've shown so Avatar of the person chatting continue! "We must continue on our journey, Clara," Alistair said, as they gazed upon the ancient artifact they had sought for so long. "There are still many trials and challenges ahead of us, and we must be ready to face them all." "I know," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But I am ready for whatever comes our way. We will overcome any obstacle that stands in our path, and we will emerge victorious." "That's the spirit," Alistair said, clapping her on the shoulder. "We will face each challenge with courage and determination, and we will emerge stronger and wiser than before." And so they set off once more, their journey far from over. They braved treacherous mountains and dark caves, facing all manner of enemies and obstacles along the way. They fought against fierce beasts and powerful foes, using their skills and cunning to emerge victorious. And at last, they reached the end of their journey, their trials and challenges behind them. "We did it, Clara," Alistair said, his voice filled with pride and joy. "We overcame every obstacle in our path, and we have emerged stronger and wiser than ever before." "Yes, we did," Clara replied, a smile on her face. "And now, we are ready to face whatever comes our way. We will protect this world from all dangers, and we will be its heroes." Avatar of the person chatting Tell me of Clara's triumphant return to confront the king and the dark elves, with the dwarves at her side. After completing her ten trials and challenges, Clara returned to her homeland, ready to face the greatest challenge of all. She was determined to put an end to the machinations of the king and the dark elves, who had been manipulating and exploiting the other races for their own gain. With the dwarves at her side, she marched on the capital city, her heart filled with determination and resolve. The people of the city cheered as she approached, their spirits lifted by the sight of their hero, who had overcome so much to return to them. "People of the city, hear me!" Clara shouted, her voice ringing out across the city. "The king and the dark elves have been manipulating and exploiting us for their own gain. They must be stopped, and I will not rest until they are brought to justice!" The people cheered even louder, their spirits lifted by Clara's words. And with the support of the dwarves and the people, Clara set out to face the king and the dark elves, ready to put an end to their scheming once and for all. The battle was fierce, as the king and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their strength and skill. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the king and the dark elves were brought to justice. The people celebrated, their spirits lifted by the victory of their hero and her allies. And Clara, at last, knew that she had truly become a hero, ready to face any challenge that came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Tell me the story again, but note that dark elves are usually not physically present in the human lands. Also be aware that Clara's victory will be pyrrhic, as if she takes down the king and the dark elves, something bad will happen. Be creative and use dialog as before. Take your time and elaborate on the details, please. If dark elves are confronted, Clara must likely go to the dark elves herself, rather than them coming to her. Clara and Alistair marched on the capital city, ready to face the greatest challenge of their lives. They knew that the dark elves were rarely seen in the human lands, preferring to operate in the shadows and manipulate events from afar. But they were determined to put an end to their scheming and exploitation, and they were not afraid of what they might face. "We must be ready for anything, Clara," Alistair said, his voice grim. "The dark elves are cunning and dangerous, and they will stop at nothing to protect their power and position." "I know, Alistair," Clara replied, her eyes shining with determination. "But we cannot let them continue to manipulate and exploit the other races for their own gain. We must stop them, no matter what the cost." And so they marched on, their hearts filled with determination and resolve. They faced all manner of obstacles and challenges along the way, fighting against fierce beasts and powerful enemies. But they did not falter, and they emerged victorious from every battle. At last, they reached the capital city, and they faced their greatest challenge yet. The dark elves were waiting for them, their eyes glowing with malice and hatred. "You have come far, Clara," the leader of the dark elves said, his voice cold and mocking. "But you will not prevail against us. We are too powerful, and you are but a mere mortal." "I may be mortal, but I am not alone," Clara replied, her voice firm and resolute. "I have the support of the dwarves, and the people of the city. And together, we will stop you and your scheming once and for all." And so the battle began, with Clara and her allies fighting against the dark elves with all their strength and skill. The fighting was fierce, and the dark elves fought with all their might to defend their power and position. But Clara and her allies were determined, and they fought with all their heart and soul. In the end, they emerged victorious, and the dark elves were defeated. But even as they celebrated their victory, Clara knew that it was a pyrrhic one. For in defeating the king and the dark elves, she had unleashed a greater evil upon the world, one that would haunt her for the rest of her days. Avatar of the person chatting 2 / 2The king was secretly a dark elf! How did that come about? Using the same style, explain tell the story of how the king became a dark elf as Clara talks to some people at the king's castle. Clara and Alistair made their way to the king's castle, determined to uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves. As they walked through the castle, they encountered several people, and Clara took the opportunity to question them about the king and his true nature. "Tell me, how did the king become a dark elf?" Clara asked a guard, her voice filled with determination. The guard looked at her nervously, clearly uncomfortable with the question. "I-I'm not sure, my lady," he stammered. "But I do know that the king has been acting strange lately, and that he has been spending a lot of time with the dark elves." "I see," Clara said, her eyes narrowed. "And do you know why he would do such a thing?" The guard shook his head. "No, my lady. But I have heard rumors that the king is searching for something, something that only the dark elves can provide. But I do not know what it is." Clara nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. It was clear that the king had become a dark elf, but she still did not know why. She would have to continue her investigations, and uncover the truth at all costs. For the fate of the kingdom depended on it. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story as the loony bin shows up and takes Clara away, who goes unwillingly. Clara and Alistair continued to investigate the king and the dark elves, but their efforts were soon interrupted by a group of guards from the loony bin. "Come with us, Clara," one of the guards said, his voice stern. "You are a danger to yourself and others, and must be taken to the loony bin for your own safety." "No, I will not go!" Clara protested, her voice filled with fear and determination. "I must continue my investigation, and uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves!" But the guards would not listen, and they forcibly escorted Clara to the loony bin. Alistair tried to follow, but he was stopped by the guards and left behind. Inside the loony bin, Clara was subjected to all manner of treatments and therapies, designed to break her will and make her more compliant. But Clara refused to give in, and she continued to fight against the guards and the doctors, determined to escape and continue her quest. But it was not easy, and Clara found herself struggling against impossible odds. She knew that she must find a way to escape, and continue her quest to uncover the truth and stop the dark elves once and for all. Avatar of the person chatting Clara's struggle is now in her mind. Tell of Clara's struggle using the style we have developed, but using her journeys and trials as metaphors for her demons. As Clara struggled to escape from the loony bin, she found herself fighting against not just the guards and doctors, but also against the demons in her own mind. She was plagued by doubts and fears, and it seemed that every step she took was met with some new challenge or obstacle. But Clara refused to give up, and she continued to push forward, determined to overcome her inner demons and emerge victorious. She fought against the darkness in her mind, just as she had fought against the orc warlord on the ice mountain, and the dragon in the ruins of the ancient temple. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Clara emerged victorious, her mind clear and focused once again. She knew what she had to do, and she was ready to face the dark elves and the treacherous king. With renewed determination, Clara made her escape from the loony bin, and set out on the final leg of her quest. She would stop at nothing to uncover the truth and put an end to the dark elves and their scheming once and for all. The fate of the kingdom rested on her shoulders, and she was ready to face whatever came her way. Avatar of the person chatting Clara stabs one of the asylum staff and escapes. She becomes wanted. Please continue, using dialog, as Clara runs on the lam, penniless and without her gear, wearing only the threadbare peasant's garb provided by the loony bin. Describe what Clara hopes to accomplish in the future. Clara managed to escape from the loony bin, but not without leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. She had been pushed to the brink, and she was not afraid to fight back against those who would stand in her way. Now, Clara was on the run, wanted by the authorities for her crimes. She was penniless and without her gear, forced to rely on her wits and cunning to survive. She wore only the threadbare peasant's garb provided by the loony bin, and she was constantly on the move, trying to avoid capture. Despite her difficult circumstances, Clara remained determined and focused. She knew what she had to do, and she was not going to let anything stand in her way. She would uncover the truth about the king and the dark elves, and put an end to their scheming once and for all. As she ran on the lam, Clara encountered many challenges and obstacles, but she refused to give up. She fought against bandits and thieves, and she braved the dangers of the wilds, all in pursuit of her goal. And in the end, she knew that she would emerge victorious, and that the kingdom would be safe once again. Avatar of the person chatting The king is dead and the dark elves have retreated from the kingdom, but Clara doesn't know any of it yet. What does she do next? Please continue. Even though the king was dead and the dark elves had retreated from the kingdom, Clara was still on the run, unaware of the events that had transpired. She continued to evade the authorities, determined to uncover the truth about the dark elves and bring them to justice. But as she traveled, Clara began to realize that something was different. The kingdom felt changed, as if a great weight had been lifted from its shoulders. She heard whispers of a new king, one who was kind and just, and who had brought peace to the land. Despite her initial skepticism, Clara couldn't help but be drawn to these stories, and she began to wonder if perhaps her quest was over. She had been fighting for so long, and she was exhausted and weary. Was it finally time for her to lay down her sword and rest? Clara didn't know the answer, but she continued to travel, searching for answers and trying to make sense of the new world around her. She was no longer sure of her place in it, but she was determined to find out, no matter what it took. Avatar of the person chatting Continue the story, telling of Clara's journey to meet the king, Alistair. Clara's journey to meet the new king, Alistair, was filled with uncertainty and doubt. She had been on the run for so long, and she wasn't sure what to expect when she finally met the man who had taken the throne. As she traveled, Clara encountered many people who had been touched by Alistair's rule, and she heard countless stories of his kindness and justice. She was surprised by the change in the kingdom, and she couldn't help but feel a growing sense of hope. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. Alistair was everything that Clara had heard and more, and she was struck by his wisdom and compassion. As they talked, Clara began to understand the true extent of Alistair's power, and she realized that he was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Try that again, noting that Clara knows Alistair well and has been travelling with him. She doesn't know the king is Alistair until she seems him. Clara had been traveling with Alistair for many weeks, but she had no idea that he was the new king of Graniphor. She had been on the run for so long, and she had never expected to find a friend like Alistair. As they journeyed together, Clara began to see the changes in the kingdom, and she heard countless stories of the new king's kindness and justice. She was filled with hope and wonder, and she couldn't help but feel drawn to the man who had brought peace to the land. Finally, after many long weeks of travel, Clara arrived at the gates of the royal palace, where she was greeted by the king himself. She was shocked to see that it was Alistair, and she couldn't believe that her friend was the most powerful man in the kingdom. As they talked, Clara realized that Alistair was the key to finally bringing peace to the kingdom. She vowed to serve him, and to help him build a better future for all the people of Graniphor. Together, they would conquer the darkness and restore order to the land. Avatar of the person chatting Using conversation and drama, tell the story of Clara and Alistair's wedding and the disastrous aftermath. Clara and Alistair's wedding was a joyous occasion, celebrated by the people of Graniphor as the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity. The bride and groom were radiant, and they exchanged vows beneath a beautiful archway of flowers. As they danced at their reception, surrounded by friends and loved ones, Clara and Alistair were the happiest they had ever been. But their joy was short-lived, as a messenger arrived with terrible news. The dark elves, driven into hiding by Alistair's rule, had emerged from the shadows with a vengeance. They had attacked the kingdom's border cities, and they were marching on the capital. Clara and Alistair knew that they had to act quickly if they were to save their people. They gathered their most trusted allies, and they rode out to meet the dark elves in battle. The fighting was fierce, and many brave warriors fell. But in the end, Clara and Alistair emerged victorious, thanks to their bravery and skill. But their victory was bittersweet, as they returned to the capital to find that the dark elves had laid waste to the city in their absence. Clara and Alistair knew that they had much work to do if they were to rebuild their kingdom and protect their people from the darkness that threatened them. Avatar of the person chatting Tell the story of the building of the new capitol. What do they choose to name it? Use lots of dialog between Alistair and Clara. Alistair and Clara's tensions are running high and they aren't getting along very well, though they love each other and must stay married.

"EN EN EUROPEAN COMMISSION Brussels, 21.4.2021 COM(2021) 206 final 2021/0106 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS {SEC(2021) 167 final} - {SWD(2021) 84 final} - {SWD(2021) 85 final} EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery, the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes and provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such action is especially needed in high-impact sectors, including climate change, environment and health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same elements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about new risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of technological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced approach. It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to ensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning according to Union values, fundamental rights and principles. This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who announced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission “A Union that strives for more”1 , that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on 19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach to excellence and trust2 . The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the twin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain uses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the development of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. The proposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other users the confidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop them. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being. Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise affecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that the technology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect of fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission launched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met with a great interest by a large number of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the challenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI. The proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the European Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a well-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both benefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level. It supports the objective of the Union being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial 1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission\\_en.pdf 2 European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final, 2020. EN 2 EN intelligence as stated by the European Council3 and ensures the protection of ethical principles as specifically requested by the European Parliament4 . In 2017, the European Council called for a ‘sense of urgency to address emerging trends’ including ‘issues such as artificial intelligence …, while at the same time ensuring a high level of data protection, digital rights and ethical standards’5 . In its 2019 Conclusions on the Coordinated Plan on the development and use of artificial intelligence Made in Europe6 , the Council further highlighted the importance of ensuring that European citizens’ rights are fully respected and called for a review of the existing relevant legislation to make it fit for purpose for the new opportunities and challenges raised by AI. The European Council has also called for a clear determination of the AI applications that should be considered high-risk7 . The most recent Conclusions from 21 October 2020 further called for addressing the opacity, complexity, bias, a certain degree of unpredictability and partially autonomous behaviour of certain AI systems, to ensure their compatibility with fundamental rights and to facilitate the enforcement of legal rules8 . The European Parliament has also undertaken a considerable amount of work in the area of AI. In October 2020, it adopted a number of resolutions related to AI, including on ethics9 , liability10 and copyright11. In 2021, those were followed by resolutions on AI in criminal matters12 and in education, culture and the audio-visual sector13. The EP Resolution on a Framework of Ethical Aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Related Technologies specifically recommends to the Commission to propose legislative action to harness the opportunities and benefits of AI, but also to ensure protection of ethical principles. The resolution includes a text of the legislative proposal for a regulation on ethical principles for the development, deployment and use of AI, robotics and related technologies. In accordance with the political commitment made by President von der Leyen in her Political Guidelines as regards resolutions adopted by the European Parliament under Article 225 TFEU, this 3 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions, EUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6. 4 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies, 2020/2012(INL). 5 European Council, European Council meeting (19 October 2017) – Conclusion EUCO 14/17, 2017, p. 8. 6 Council of the European Union, Artificial intelligence b) Conclusions on the coordinated plan on artificial intelligence-Adoption 6177/19, 2019. 7 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions EUCO 13/20, 2020. 8 Council of the European Union, Presidency conclusions - The Charter of Fundamental Rights in the context of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Change, 11481/20, 2020. 9 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies, 2020/2012(INL). 10 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on a civil liability regime for artificial intelligence, 2020/2014(INL). 11 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence technologies, 2020/2015(INI). 12 European Parliament Draft Report, Artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters, 2020/2016(INI). 13 European Parliament Draft Report, Artificial intelligence in education, culture and the audiovisual sector, 2020/2017(INI). In that regard, the Commission has adopted the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027: Resetting education and training for the digital age, which foresees the development of ethical guidelines in AI and Data usage in education – Commission Communication COM(2020) 624 final. EN 3 EN proposal takes into account the aforementioned resolution of the European Parliament in full respect of proportionality, subsidiarity and better law making principles. Against this political context, the Commission puts forward the proposed regulatory framework on Artificial Intelligence with the following specific objectives: \uf0b7 ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values; \uf0b7 ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI; \uf0b7 enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems; \uf0b7 facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation. To achieve those objectives, this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal regulatory approach to AI that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address the risks and problems linked to AI, without unduly constraining or hindering technological development or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on the market. The proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework. On the one hand, it is comprehensive and future-proof in its fundamental regulatory choices, including the principle-based requirements that AI systems should comply with. On the other hand, it puts in place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well-defined risk-based regulatory approach that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade, whereby legal intervention is tailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the legal framework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge. The proposal sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems in the Union following a proportionate risk-based approach. It proposes a single future-proof definition of AI. Certain particularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as contravening Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in relation to certain uses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law enforcement. The proposal lays down a solid risk methodology to define “high-risk” AI systems that pose significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons. Those AI systems will have to comply with a set of horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI and follow conformity assessment procedures before those systems can be placed on the Union market. Predictable, proportionate and clear obligations are also placed on providers and users of those systems to ensure safety and respect of existing legislation protecting fundamental rights throughout the whole AI systems’ lifecycle. For some specific AI systems, only minimum transparency obligations are proposed, in particular when chatbots or ‘deep fakes’ are used. The proposed rules will be enforced through a governance system at Member States level, building on already existing structures, and a cooperation mechanism at Union level with the establishment of a European Artificial Intelligence Board. Additional measures are also proposed to support innovation, in particular through AI regulatory sandboxes and other measures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (‘SMEs’) and start-ups. EN 4 EN 1.2. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The horizontal nature of the proposal requires full consistency with existing Union legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk AI systems are already used or likely to be used in the near future. Consistency is also ensured with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the existing secondary Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection, non-discrimination and gender equality. The proposal is without prejudice and complements the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) with a set of harmonised rules applicable to the design, development and use of certain high-risk AI systems and restrictions on certain uses of remote biometric identification systems. Furthermore, the proposal complements existing Union law on non-discrimination with specific requirements that aim to minimise the risk of algorithmic discrimination, in particular in relation to the design and the quality of data sets used for the development of AI systems complemented with obligations for testing, risk management, documentation and human oversight throughout the AI systems’ lifecycle. The proposal is without prejudice to the application of Union competition law. As regards high-risk AI systems which are safety components of products, this proposal will be integrated into the existing sectoral safety legislation to ensure consistency, avoid duplications and minimise additional burdens. In particular, as regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by the New Legislative Framework (NLF) legislation (e.g. machinery, medical devices, toys), the requirements for AI systems set out in this proposal will be checked as part of the existing conformity assessment procedures under the relevant NLF legislation. With regard to the interplay of requirements, while the safety risks specific to AI systems are meant to be covered by the requirements of this proposal, NLF legislation aims at ensuring the overall safety of the final product and therefore may contain specific requirements regarding the safe integration of an AI system into the final product. The proposal for a Machinery Regulation, which is adopted on the same day as this proposal fully reflects this approach. As regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by relevant Old Approach legislation (e.g. aviation, cars), this proposal would not directly apply. However, the ex-ante essential requirements for high-risk AI systems set out in this proposal will have to be taken into account when adopting relevant implementing or delegated legislation under those acts. As regards AI systems provided or used by regulated credit institutions, the authorities responsible for the supervision of the Union’s financial services legislation should be designated as competent authorities for supervising the requirements in this proposal to ensure a coherent enforcement of the obligations under this proposal and the Union’s financial services legislation where AI systems are to some extent implicitly regulated in relation to the internal governance system of credit institutions. To further enhance consistency, the conformity assessment procedure and some of the providers’ procedural obligations under this proposal are integrated into the procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision14 . 14 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC Text with EEA relevance, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338–436. EN 5 EN This proposal is also consistent with the applicable Union legislation on services, including on intermediary services regulated by the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC15 and the Commission’s recent proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA)16 . In relation to AI systems that are components of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice managed by the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA), the proposal will not apply to those AI systems that have been placed on the market or put into service before one year has elapsed from the date of application of this Regulation, unless the replacement or amendment of those legal acts leads to a significant change in the design or intended purpose of the AI system or AI systems concerned. 1.3. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is part of a wider comprehensive package of measures that address problems posed by the development and use of AI, as examined in the White Paper on AI. Consistency and complementarity is therefore ensured with other ongoing or planned initiatives of the Commission that also aim to address those problems, including the revision of sectoral product legislation (e.g. the Machinery Directive, the General Product Safety Directive) and initiatives that address liability issues related to new technologies, including AI systems. Those initiatives will build on and complement this proposal in order to bring legal clarity and foster the development of an ecosystem of trust in AI in Europe. The proposal is also coherent with the Commission’s overall digital strategy in its contribution to promoting technology that works for people, one of the three main pillars of the policy orientation and objectives announced in the Communication ‘Shaping Europe\'s digital future’17. It lays down a coherent, effective and proportionate framework to ensure AI is developed in ways that respect people’s rights and earn their trust, making Europe fit for the digital age and turning the next ten years into the Digital Decade18 . Furthermore, the promotion of AI-driven innovation is closely linked to the Data Governance Act19 , the Open Data Directive20 and other initiatives under the EU strategy for data21, which will establish trusted mechanisms and services for the re-use, sharing and pooling of data that are essential for the development of data-driven AI models of high quality. The proposal also strengthens significantly the Union’s role to help shape global norms and standards and promote trustworthy AI that is consistent with Union values and interests. It provides the Union with a powerful basis to engage further with its external partners, including third countries, and at international fora on issues relating to AI. 15 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\'Directive on electronic commerce\'), OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1–16. 16 See Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) and amending Directive 2000/31/EC COM/2020/825 final. 17 Communication from the Commission, Shaping Europe\'s Digital Future, COM/2020/67 final. 18 2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade. 19 Proposal for a Regulation on European data governance (Data Governance Act) COM/2020/767. 20 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information, PE/28/2019/REV/1, OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56–83. 21 Commission Communication, A European strategy for data COM/2020/66 final. EN 6 EN 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY 2.1. Legal basis The legal basis for the proposal is in the first place Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the adoption of measures to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market. This proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market strategy. The primary objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by setting harmonised rules in particular on the development, placing on the Union market and the use of products and services making use of AI technologies or provided as stand-alone AI systems. Some Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. This will likely lead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of the internal market on essential elements regarding in particular the requirements for the AI products and services, their marketing, their use, the liability and the supervision by public authorities, and ii) the substantial diminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on how existing and new rules will apply to those systems in the Union. Given the wide circulation of products and services across borders, these two problems can be best solved through EU harmonizing legislation. Indeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and development of certain AI systems before they are placed on the market that will be further operationalised through harmonised technical standards. The proposal also addresses the situation after AI systems have been placed on the market by harmonising the way in which ex-post controls are conducted. In addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, notably restrictions of the use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. 2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which may be embedded in any product or service circulating freely within the internal market, entails that the objectives of this proposal cannot be effectively achieved by Member States alone. Furthermore, an emerging patchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the seamless circulation of products and services related to AI systems across the EU and will be ineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values across the different Member States. National approaches in addressing the problems will only create additional legal uncertainty and barriers, and will slow market uptake of AI. The objectives of this proposal can be better achieved at Union level to avoid a further fragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory national frameworks preventing the free circulation of goods and services embedding AI. A solid European regulatory framework for trustworthy AI will also ensure a level playing field and protect all people, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Only common action at Union level can also protect the Union’s digital sovereignty and leverage its tools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards. EN 7 EN 2.3. Proportionality The proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to achieve its objectives, since it follows a risk-based approach and imposes regulatory burdens only when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. For other, non-high-risk AI systems, only very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for example in terms of the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when interacting with humans. For high-risk AI systems, the requirements of high quality data, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness, are strictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that are not covered by other existing legal frameworks. Harmonised standards and supporting guidance and compliance tools will assist providers and users in complying with the requirements laid down by the proposal and minimise their costs. The costs incurred by operators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the economic and reputational benefits that operators can expect from this proposal. 2.4. Choice of the instrument The choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the prohibition of certain harmful AI\x02enabled practices and the classification of certain AI systems. The direct applicability of a Regulation, in accordance with Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems. It will do so, in particular, by introducing a harmonised set of core requirements with regard to AI systems classified as high-risk and obligations for providers and users of those systems, improving the protection of fundamental rights and providing legal certainty for operators and consumers alike. At the same time, the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive and leave room for different levels of Member State action for elements that do not undermine the objectives of the initiative, in particular the internal organisation of the market surveillance system and the uptake of measures to foster innovation. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS 3.1. Stakeholder consultation This proposal is the result of extensive consultation with all major stakeholders, in which the general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission were applied. An online public consultation was launched on 19 February 2020 along with the publication of the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and ran until 14 June 2020. The objective of that consultation was to collect views and opinions on the White Paper. It targeted all interested stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including governments, local authorities, commercial and non-commercial organisations, social partners, experts, academics and citizens. After analysing all the responses received, the Commission published a summary outcome and the individual responses on its website22 . In total, 1215 contributions were received, of which 352 were from companies or business organisations/associations, 406 from individuals (92%individuals from EU ), 152 on behalf of 22 See all consultation results here. EN 8 EN academic/research institutions, and 73 from public authorities. Civil society’s voices were represented by 160 respondents (among which 9 consumers’ organisations, 129 non\x02governmental organisations and 22 trade unions), 72 respondents contributed as ‘others’. Of the 352 business and industry representatives, 222 were companies and business representatives, 41.5% of which were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The rest were business associations. Overall, 84% of business and industry replies came from the EU\x0227. Depending on the question, between 81 and 598 of the respondents used the free text option to insert comments. Over 450 position papers were submitted through the EU Survey website, either in addition to questionnaire answers (over 400) or as stand-alone contributions (over 50). Overall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on a need for action. A large majority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or that new legislation is needed. However, several stakeholders warn the Commission to avoid duplication, conflicting obligations and overregulation. There were many comments underlining the importance of a technology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework. Stakeholders mostly requested a narrow, clear and precise definition for AI. Stakeholders also highlighted that besides the clarification of the term of AI, it is important to define ‘risk’, ‘high-risk’, ‘low-risk’, ‘remote biometric identification’ and ‘harm’. Most of the respondents are explicitly in favour of the risk-based approach. Using a risk-based framework was considered a better option than blanket regulation of all AI systems. The types of risks and threats should be based on a sector-by-sector and case-by-case approach. Risks also should be calculated taking into account the impact on rights and safety. Regulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of AI and are welcomed by certain stakeholders, especially the Business Associations. Among those who formulated their opinion on the enforcement models, more than 50%, especially from the business associations, were in favour of a combination of an ex-ante risk self-assessment and an ex-post enforcement for high-risk AI systems. 3.2. Collection and use of expertise The proposal builds on two years of analysis and close involvement of stakeholders, including academics, businesses, social partners, non-governmental organisations, Member States and citizens. The preparatory work started in 2018 with the setting up of a High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) which had an inclusive and broad composition of 52 well-known experts tasked to advise the Commission on the implementation of the Commission’s Strategy on Artificial Intelligence. In April 2019, the Commission supported23 the key requirements set out in the HLEG ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI24, which had been revised to take into account more than 500 submissions from stakeholders. The key requirements reflect a widespread and common approach, as evidenced by a plethora of ethical codes and principles developed by many private and public organisations in Europe and beyond, that AI development and use should be guided by certain essential value-oriented principles. The Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)25 made those requirements operational in a piloting process with over 350 organisations. 23 European Commission, Building Trust in Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence, COM(2019) 168. 24 HLEG, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, 2019. 25 HLEG, Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) for self-assessment, 2020. EN 9 EN In addition, the AI Alliance26 was formed as a platform for approximately 4000 stakeholders to debate the technological and societal implications of AI, culminating in a yearly AI Assembly. The White Paper on AI further developed this inclusive approach, inciting comments from more than 1250 stakeholders, including over 450 additional position papers. As a result, the Commission published an Inception Impact Assessment, which in turn attracted more than 130 comments 27 . Additional stakeholder workshops and events were also organised the results of which support the analysis in the impact assessment and the policy choices made in this proposal28. An external study was also procured to feed into the impact assessment. 3.3. Impact assessment In line with its “Better Regulation” policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment for this proposal examined by the Commission\'s Regulatory Scrutiny Board. A meeting with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was held on 16 December 2020, which was followed by a negative opinion. After substantial revision of the impact assessment to address the comments and a resubmission of the impact assessment, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on 21 March 2021. The opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, the recommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account are presented in Annex 1 of the impact assessment. The Commission examined different policy options to achieve the general objective of the proposal, which is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market by creating the conditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI in the Union. Four policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessed: \uf0b7 Option 1: EU legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling scheme; \uf0b7 Option 2: a sectoral, “ad-hoc” approach; \uf0b7 Option 3: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk\x02based approach; \uf0b7 Option 3+: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk\x02based approach + codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems; \uf0b7 Option 4: Horizontal EU legislative instrument establishing mandatory requirements for all AI systems, irrespective of the risk they pose. According to the Commission\'s established methodology, each policy option was evaluated against economic and societal impacts, with a particular focus on impacts on fundamental rights. The preferred option is option 3+, a regulatory framework for high-risk AI systems only, with the possibility for all providers of non-high-risk AI systems to follow a code of conduct. The requirements will concern data, documentation and traceability, provision of information and transparency, human oversight and robustness and accuracy and would be mandatory for high-risk AI systems. Companies that introduced codes of conduct for other AI systems would do so voluntarily. 26 The AI Alliance is a multi-stakeholder forum launched in June 2018, AI Alliance https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-ai-alliance 27 European Commission, Inception Impact Assessment For a Proposal for a legal act of the European Parliament and the Council laying down requirements for Artificial Intelligence. 28 For details of all the consultations that have been carried out see Annex 2 of the impact assessment. EN 10 EN The preferred option was considered suitable to address in the most effective way the objectives of this proposal. By requiring a restricted yet effective set of actions from AI developers and users, the preferred option limits the risks of violation of fundamental rights and safety of people and foster effective supervision and enforcement, by targeting the requirements only to systems where there is a high risk that such violations could occur. As a result, that option keeps compliance costs to a minimum, thus avoiding an unnecessary slowing of uptake due to higher prices and compliance costs. In order to address possible disadvantages for SMEs, this option includes several provisions to support their compliance and reduce their costs, including creation of regulatory sandboxes and obligation to consider SMEs interests when setting fees related to conformity assessment. The preferred option will increase people’s trust in AI, companies will gain in legal certainty, and Member States will see no reason to take unilateral action that could fragment the single market. As a result of higher demand due to higher trust, more available offers due to legal certainty, and the absence of obstacles to cross-border movement of AI systems, the single market for AI will likely flourish. The European Union will continue to develop a fast\x02growing AI ecosystem of innovative services and products embedding AI technology or stand-alone AI systems, resulting in increased digital autonomy. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use AI applications that constitute a high risk for the safety or fundamental rights of citizens would have to comply with specific requirements and obligations. Compliance with these requirements would imply costs amounting to approximately EUR € 6000 to EUR € 7000 for the supply of an average high\x02risk AI system of around EUR € 170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the annual cost for the time spent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate, depending on the use case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR € 5000 to EUR € 8000 per year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR € 3000 to EUR € 7500 for suppliers of high-risk AI. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use any AI applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information. However, they could choose to join others and together adopt a code of conduct to follow suitable requirements, and to ensure that their AI systems are trustworthy. In such a case, costs would be at most as high as for high-risk AI systems, but most probably lower. The impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders (economic operators/ business; conformity assessment bodies, standardisation bodies and other public bodies; individuals/citizens; researchers) are explained in detail in Annex 3 of the Impact assessment supporting this proposal. 3.4. Regulatory fitness and simplification This proposal lays down obligation that will apply to providers and users of high-risk AI systems. For providers who develop and place such systems on the Union market, it will create legal certainty and ensure that no obstacle to the cross-border provision of AI-related services and products emerge. For companies using AI, it will promote trust among their customers. For national public administrations, it will promote public trust in the use of AI and strengthen enforcement mechanisms (by introducing a European coordination mechanism, providing for appropriate capacities, and facilitating audits of the AI systems with new requirements for documentation, traceability and transparency). Moreover, the framework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation, including regulatory sandboxes and specific measures supporting small-scale users and providers of high-risk AI systems to comply with the new rules. The proposal also specifically aims at strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral Union legislation applicable to EN 11 EN AI systems (e.g. on products and services) that will bring further clarity and simplify the enforcement of the new rules. 3.5. Fundamental rights The use of AI with its specific characteristics (e.g. opacity, complexity, dependency on data, autonomous behaviour) can adversely affect a number of fundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (‘the Charter’). This proposal seeks to ensure a high level of protection for those fundamental rights and aims to address various sources of risks through a clearly defined risk-based approach. With a set of requirements for trustworthy AI and proportionate obligations on all value chain participants, the proposal will enhance and promote the protection of the rights protected by the Charter: the right to human dignity (Article 1), respect for private life and protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8), non\x02discrimination (Article 21) and equality between women and men (Article 23). It aims to prevent a chilling effect on the rights to freedom of expression (Article 11) and freedom of assembly (Article 12), to ensure protection of the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the rights of defence and the presumption of innocence (Articles 47 and 48), as well as the general principle of good administration. Furthermore, as applicable in certain domains, the proposal will positively affect the rights of a number of special groups, such as the workers’ rights to fair and just working conditions (Article 31), a high level of consumer protection (Article 28), the rights of the child (Article 24) and the integration of persons with disabilities (Article 26). The right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment (Article 37) is also relevant, including in relation to the health and safety of people. The obligations for ex ante testing, risk management and human oversight will also facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary. In case infringements of fundamental rights still happen, effective redress for affected persons will be made possible by ensuring transparency and traceability of the AI systems coupled with strong ex post controls. This proposal imposes some restrictions on the freedom to conduct business (Article 16) and the freedom of art and science (Article 13) to ensure compliance with overriding reasons of public interest such as health, safety, consumer protection and the protection of other fundamental rights (‘responsible innovation’) when high-risk AI technology is developed and used. Those restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to prevent and mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of fundamental rights. The increased transparency obligations will also not disproportionately affect the right to protection of intellectual property (Article 17(2)), since they will be limited only to the minimum necessary information for individuals to exercise their right to an effective remedy and to the necessary transparency towards supervision and enforcement authorities, in line with their mandates. Any disclosure of information will be carried out in compliance with relevant legislation in the field, including Directive 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure. When public authorities and notified bodies need to be given access to confidential information or source code to examine compliance with substantial obligations, they are placed under binding confidentiality obligations. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS Member States will have to designate supervisory authorities in charge of implementing the legislative requirements. Their supervisory function could build on existing arrangements, for EN 12 EN example regarding conformity assessment bodies or market surveillance, but would require sufficient technological expertise and human and financial resources. Depending on the pre\x02existing structure in each Member State, this could amount to 1 to 25 Full Time Equivalents per Member State. A detailed overview of the costs involved is provided in the ‘financial statement’ linked to this proposal. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS 5.1. Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements Providing for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the proposal will be effective in achieving its specific objectives. The Commission will be in charge of monitoring the effects of the proposal. It will establish a system for registering stand-alone high-risk AI applications in a public EU-wide database. This registration will also enable competent authorities, users and other interested people to verify if the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements laid down in the proposal and to exercise enhanced oversight over those AI systems posing high risks to fundamental rights. To feed this database, AI providers will be obliged to provide meaningful information about their systems and the conformity assessment carried out on those systems. Moreover, AI providers will be obliged to inform national competent authorities about serious incidents or malfunctioning that constitute a breach of fundamental rights obligations as soon as they become aware of them, as well as any recalls or withdrawals of AI systems from the market. National competent authorities will then investigate the incidents/or malfunctioning, collect all the necessary information and regularly transmit it to the Commission with adequate metadata. The Commission will complement this information on the incidents by a comprehensive analysis of the overall market for AI. The Commission will publish a report evaluating and reviewing the proposed AI framework five years following the date on which it becomes applicable. 5.2. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal 5.2.1. SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS (TITLE I) Title I defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new rules that cover the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems. It also sets out the definitions used throughout the instrument. The definition of AI system in the legal framework aims to be as technology neutral and future proof as possible, taking into account the fast technological and market developments related to AI. In order to provide the needed legal certainty, Title I is complemented by Annex I, which contains a detailed list of approaches and techniques for the development of AI to be adapted by the Commission in line with new technological developments. Key participants across the AI value chain are also clearly defined such as providers and users of AI systems that cover both public and private operators to ensure a level playing field. 5.2.2. PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES (TITLE II) Title II establishes a list of prohibited AI. The regulation follows a risk-based approach, differentiating between uses of AI that create (i) an unacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii) low or minimal risk. The list of prohibited practices in Title II comprises all those AI systems whose use is considered unacceptable as contravening Union values, for instance by violating fundamental rights. The prohibitions covers practices that have a significant potential to manipulate persons through subliminal techniques beyond their consciousness or exploit EN 13 EN vulnerabilities of specific vulnerable groups such as children or persons with disabilities in order to materially distort their behaviour in a manner that is likely to cause them or another person psychological or physical harm. Other manipulative or exploitative practices affecting adults that might be facilitated by AI systems could be covered by the existing data protection, consumer protection and digital service legislation that guarantee that natural persons are properly informed and have free choice not to be subject to profiling or other practices that might affect their behaviour. The proposal also prohibits AI-based social scoring for general purposes done by public authorities. Finally, the use of ‘real time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is also prohibited unless certain limited exceptions apply. 5.2.3. HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS (TITLE III) Title III contains specific rules for AI systems that create a high risk to the health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons. In line with a risk-based approach, those high-risk AI systems are permitted on the European market subject to compliance with certain mandatory requirements and an ex-ante conformity assessment. The classification of an AI system as high-risk is based on the intended purpose of the AI system, in line with existing product safety legislation. Therefore, the classification as high-risk does not only depend on the function performed by the AI system, but also on the specific purpose and modalities for which that system is used. Chapter 1 of Title III sets the classification rules and identifies two main categories of high\x02risk AI systems: \uf0b7 AI systems intended to be used as safety component of products that are subject to third party ex-ante conformity assessment; \uf0b7 other stand-alone AI systems with mainly fundamental rights implications that are explicitly listed in Annex III. This list of high-risk AI systems in Annex III contains a limited number of AI systems whose risks have already materialised or are likely to materialise in the near future. To ensure that the regulation can be adjusted to emerging uses and applications of AI, the Commission may expand the list of high-risk AI systems used within certain pre-defined areas, by applying a set of criteria and risk assessment methodology. Chapter 2 sets out the legal requirements for high-risk AI systems in relation to data and data governance, documentation and recording keeping, transparency and provision of information to users, human oversight, robustness, accuracy and security. The proposed minimum requirements are already state-of-the-art for many diligent operators and the result of two years of preparatory work, derived from the Ethics Guidelines of the HLEG29, piloted by more than 350 organisations30. They are also largely consistent with other international recommendations and principles, which ensures that the proposed AI framework is compatible with those adopted by the EU’s international trade partners. The precise technical solutions to achieve compliance with those requirements may be provided by standards or by other technical specifications or otherwise be developed in accordance with general engineering or scientific knowledge at the discretion of the provider of the AI system. This flexibility is particularly important, because it allows providers of AI systems to choose the 29 High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, 2019. 30 They were also endorsed by the Commission in its 2019 Communication on human-centric approach to AI. EN 14 EN way to meet their requirements, taking into account the state-of-the-art and technological and scientific progress in this field. Chapter 3 places a clear set of horizontal obligations on providers of high-risk AI systems. Proportionate obligations are also placed on users and other participants across the AI value chain (e.g., importers, distributors, authorized representatives). Chapter 4 sets the framework for notified bodies to be involved as independent third parties in conformity assessment procedures, while Chapter 5 explains in detail the conformity assessment procedures to be followed for each type of high-risk AI system. The conformity assessment approach aims to minimise the burden for economic operators as well as for notified bodies, whose capacity needs to be progressively ramped up over time. AI systems intended to be used as safety components of products that are regulated under the New Legislative Framework legislation (e.g. machinery, toys, medical devices, etc.) will be subject to the same ex-ante and ex-post compliance and enforcement mechanisms of the products of which they are a component. The key difference is that the ex-ante and ex-post mechanisms will ensure compliance not only with the requirements established by sectorial legislation, but also with the requirements established by this regulation. As regards stand-alone high-risk AI systems that are referred to in Annex III, a new compliance and enforcement system will be established. This follows the model of the New Legislative Framework legislation implemented through internal control checks by the providers with the exception of remote biometric identification systems that would be subject to third party conformity assessment. A comprehensive ex-ante conformity assessment through internal checks, combined with a strong ex-post enforcement, could be an effective and reasonable solution for those systems, given the early phase of the regulatory intervention and the fact the AI sector is very innovative and expertise for auditing is only now being accumulated. An assessment through internal checks for ‘stand-alone’ high-risk AI systems would require a full, effective and properly documented ex ante compliance with all requirements of the regulation and compliance with robust quality and risk management systems and post-market monitoring. After the provider has performed the relevant conformity assessment, it should register those stand-alone high-risk AI systems in an EU database that will be managed by the Commission to increase public transparency and oversight and strengthen ex post supervision by competent authorities. By contrast, for reasons of consistency with the existing product safety legislation, the conformity assessments of AI systems that are safety components of products will follow a system with third party conformity assessment procedures already established under the relevant sectoral product safety legislation. New ex ante re-assessments of the conformity will be needed in case of substantial modifications to the AI systems (and notably changes which go beyond what is pre-determined by the provider in its technical documentation and checked at the moment of the ex-ante conformity assessment). 5.2.4. TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS (TITLE IV) Title IV concerns certain AI systems to take account of the specific risks of manipulation they pose. Transparency obligations will apply for systems that (i) interact with humans, (ii) are used to detect emotions or determine association with (social) categories based on biometric data, or (iii) generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’). When persons interact with an AI system or their emotions or characteristics are recognised through automated means, people must be informed of that circumstance. If an AI system is used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles authentic content, there should be an obligation to disclose that the content is generated through automated means, subject to EN 15 EN exceptions for legitimate purposes (law enforcement, freedom of expression). This allows persons to make informed choices or step back from a given situation. 5.2.5. MEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION (TITLE V) Title V contributes to the objective to create a legal framework that is innovation-friendly, future-proof and resilient to disruption. To that end, it encourages national competent authorities to set up regulatory sandboxes and sets a basic framework in terms of governance, supervision and liability. AI regulatory sandboxes establish a controlled environment to test innovative technologies for a limited time on the basis of a testing plan agreed with the competent authorities. Title V also contains measures to reduce the regulatory burden on SMEs and start-ups. 5.2.6. GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION (TITLES VI, VII AND VII) Title VI sets up the governance systems at Union and national level. At Union level, the proposal establishes a European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’), composed of representatives from the Member States and the Commission. The Board will facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this regulation by contributing to the effective cooperation of the national supervisory authorities and the Commission and providing advice and expertise to the Commission. It will also collect and share best practices among the Member States. At national level, Member States will have to designate one or more national competent authorities and, among them, the national supervisory authority, for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of the regulation. The European Data Protection Supervisor will act as the competent authority for the supervision of the Union institutions, agencies and bodies when they fall within the scope of this regulation. Title VII aims to facilitate the monitoring work of the Commission and national authorities through the establishment of an EU-wide database for stand-alone high-risk AI systems with mainly fundamental rights implications. The database will be operated by the Commission and provided with data by the providers of the AI systems, who will be required to register their systems before placing them on the market or otherwise putting them into service. Title VIII sets out the monitoring and reporting obligations for providers of AI systems with regard to post-market monitoring and reporting and investigating on AI-related incidents and malfunctioning. Market surveillance authorities would also control the market and investigate compliance with the obligations and requirements for all high-risk AI systems already placed on the market. Market surveillance authorities would have all powers under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance. Ex-post enforcement should ensure that once the AI system has been put on the market, public authorities have the powers and resources to intervene in case AI systems generate unexpected risks, which warrant rapid action. They will also monitor compliance of operators with their relevant obligations under the regulation. The proposal does not foresee the automatic creation of any additional bodies or authorities at Member State level. Member States may therefore appoint (and draw upon the expertise of) existing sectorial authorities, who would be entrusted also with the powers to monitor and enforce the provisions of the regulation. All this is without prejudice to the existing system and allocation of powers of ex-post enforcement of obligations regarding fundamental rights in the Member States. When necessary for their mandate, existing supervision and enforcement authorities will also have the power to request and access any documentation maintained following this regulation and, where needed, request market surveillance authorities to organise testing of the high-risk AI system through technical means. EN 16 EN 5.2.7. CODES OF CONDUCT (TITLE IX) Title IX creates a framework for the creation of codes of conduct, which aim to encourage providers of non-high-risk AI systems to apply voluntarily the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems (as laid out in Title III). Providers of non-high-risk AI systems may create and implement the codes of conduct themselves. Those codes may also include voluntary commitments related, for example, to environmental sustainability, accessibility for persons with disability, stakeholders’ participation in the design and development of AI systems, and diversity of development teams. 5.2.8. FINAL PROVISIONS (TITLES X, XI AND XII) Title X emphasizes the obligation of all parties to respect the confidentiality of information and data and sets out rules for the exchange of information obtained during the implementation of the regulation. Title X also includes measures to ensure the effective implementation of the regulation through effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties for infringements of the provisions. Title XI sets out rules for the exercise of delegation and implementing powers. The proposal empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to ensure uniform application of the regulation or delegated acts to update or complement the lists in Annexes I to VII. Title XII contains an obligation for the Commission to assess regularly the need for an update of Annex III and to prepare regular reports on the evaluation and review of the regulation. It also lays down final provisions, including a differentiated transitional period for the initial date of the applicability of the regulation to facilitate the smooth implementation for all parties concerned. EN 17 EN 2021/0106 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 and 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee31 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions32 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, marketing and use of artificial intelligence in conformity with Union values. This Regulation pursues a number of overriding reasons of public interest, such as a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights, and it ensures the free movement of AI-based goods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation. (2) Artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured, while divergences hampering the free circulation of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning 31 OJ C […], […], p. […]. 32 OJ C […], […], p. […]. EN 18 EN restrictions of the use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board. (3) Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that can contribute to a wide array of economic and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages to companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, farming, education and training, infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. (4) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application and use, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be material or immaterial. (5) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market and putting into service of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. By laying down those rules, this Regulation supports the objective of the Union of being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence, as stated by the European Council 33, and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European Parliament34 . (6) The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty, while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments. The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of the software, in particular the ability, for a given set of human-defined objectives, to generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions which influence the environment with which the system interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension. AI systems can be designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded). The definition of AI system should be complemented by a list of specific techniques and approaches used for its development, which should be kept up-to–date in the light of market and technological 33 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions, EUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6. 34 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies, 2020/2012(INL). EN 19 EN developments through the adoption of delegated acts by the Commission to amend that list. (7) The notion of biometric data used in this Regulation is in line with and should be interpreted consistently with the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council35, Article 3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council36 and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council37 . (8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge whether the targeted person will be present and can be identified, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Considering their different characteristics and manners in which they are used, as well as the different risks involved, a distinction should be made between ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned. (9) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to the public, irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly owned. Therefore, the notion does not cover places that are private in nature and normally not freely accessible for third parties, including law enforcement authorities, unless those parties have been specifically invited or authorised, such as homes, private clubs, offices, warehouses and factories. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. However, the mere fact that certain conditions for accessing a 35 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1). 36 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39) 37 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (Law Enforcement Directive) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89). EN 20 EN particular space may apply, such as admission tickets or age restrictions, does not mean that the space is not publicly accessible within the meaning of this Regulation. Consequently, in addition to public spaces such as streets, relevant parts of government buildings and most transport infrastructure, spaces such as cinemas, theatres, shops and shopping centres are normally also publicly accessible. Whether a given space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by\x02case basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand. (10) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to users of AI systems established within the Union. (11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk and whose effects impact natural persons located in the Union. In those circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and users of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of international agreements concluded at national or European level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its Member States. Such agreements have been concluded bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations. (12) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies when acting as a provider or user of an AI system. AI systems exclusively developed or used for military purposes should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation where that use falls under the exclusive remit of the Common Foreign and Security Policy regulated under Title V of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU). This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act]. (13) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common normative standards for all high-risk AI systems should be established. Those standards should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. EN 21 EN (14) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain artificial intelligence practices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems. (15) Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and should be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child. (16) The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems intended to distort human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, should be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components individuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of children and people due to their age, physical or mental incapacities. They do so with the intention to materially distort the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person. The intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user. Research for legitimate purposes in relation to such AI systems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not amount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural persons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. (17) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purpose by public authorities or on their behalf may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems evaluate or classify the trustworthiness of natural persons based on their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics. The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. Such AI systems should be therefore prohibited. (18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities. (19) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where EN 22 EN the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including missing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA38 if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, of the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. (20) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to appropriate limits in time and space, having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or perpetrator. The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the three situations mentioned above. (21) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use, except in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations seek to obtain an authorisation as soon as possible, whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier. (22) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its 38 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1). EN 23 EN detailed rules of national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation. (23) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive 2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to it. (24) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, including where those systems are used by competent authorities in publicly accessible spaces for other purposes than law enforcement, should continue to comply with all requirements resulting from Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. (25) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2) and (3) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules governing the forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation which require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU. (26) In accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2) and (3) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. EN 24 EN (27) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market or put into service if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any. (28) AI systems could produce adverse outcomes to health and safety of persons, in particular when such systems operate as components of products. Consistently with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high-risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, and non-discrimination, consumer protection, workers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption of innocence, right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight that children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the UNCRC General Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which require consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons. (29) As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or which are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council39, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council40, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council41, Directive 2014/90/EU of 39 Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 (OJ L 97, 9.4.2008, p. 72). 40 Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 1). 41 Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 52). EN 25 EN the European Parliament and of the Council42, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council43, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council44, Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council45, and Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council46, it is appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering with existing governance, conformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and authorities established therein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid down in this Regulation when adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts on the basis of those acts. (30) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the product in question undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning gaseous fuels, medical devices, and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. (31) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is considered ‘high-risk’ under the criteria established in the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is notably the case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the 42 Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine equipment and repealing Council Directive 96/98/EC (OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 146). 43 Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (OJ L 138, 26.5.2016, p. 44). 44 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations (EC) No 715/2007 and (EC) No 595/2009 and repealing Directive 2007/46/EC (OJ L 151, 14.6.2018, p. 1). 45 Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 (OJ L 212, 22.8.2018, p. 1). 46 Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users, amending Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulations (EC) No 78/2009, (EC) No 79/2009 and (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 631/2009, (EU) No 406/2010, (EU) No 672/2010, (EU) No 1003/2010, (EU) No 1005/2010, (EU) No 1008/2010, (EU) No 1009/2010, (EU) No 19/2011, (EU) No 109/2011, (EU) No 458/2011, (EU) No 65/2012, (EU) No 130/2012, (EU) No 347/2012, (EU) No 351/2012, (EU) No 1230/2012 and (EU) 2015/166 (OJ L 325, 16.12.2019, p. 1). EN 26 EN Council47 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council48, where a third-party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products. (32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems. (33) Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, sex or disabilities. Therefore, ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk. In view of the risks that they pose, both types of remote biometric identification systems should be subject to specific requirements on logging capabilities and human oversight. (34) As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social and economic activities. (35) AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or to evaluate persons on tests as part of or as a precondition for their education should be considered high-risk, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a person’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and used, such systems may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination. (36) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment, notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions on promotion and termination and for task allocation, monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these persons. Relevant work-related contractual relationships should involve employees and persons providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme 2021. Such persons should in principle not be considered users within the meaning of this Regulation. Throughout the recruitment process and in the 47 Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 1). 48 Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 176). EN 27 EN evaluation, promotion, or retention of persons in work-related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also impact their rights to data protection and privacy. (37) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. In particular, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to discrimination of persons or groups and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic origins, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory impacts. Considering the very limited scale of the impact and the available alternatives on the market, it is appropriate to exempt AI systems for the purpose of creditworthiness assessment and credit scoring when put into service by small-scale providers for their own use. Natural persons applying for or receiving public assistance benefits and services from public authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, they may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non\x02discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy. Those systems should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. Finally, AI systems used to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property. (38) Actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the activities in question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by law EN 28 EN enforcement authorities for individual risk assessments, polygraphs and similar tools or to detect the emotional state of natural person, to detect ‘deep fakes’, for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in criminal proceedings, for predicting the occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence based on profiling of natural persons, or assessing personality traits and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, as well as for crime analytics regarding natural persons. AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities should not be considered high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. (39) AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people who are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the actions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non\x02discriminatory nature and transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important to guarantee the respect of the fundamental rights of the affected persons, notably their rights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, international protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by the competent public authorities charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools or to detect the emotional state of a natural person; for assessing certain risks posed by natural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum; for verifying the authenticity of the relevant documents of natural persons; for assisting competent public authorities for the examination of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural persons applying for a status. AI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border control management covered by this Regulation should comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council49, the Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council50 and other relevant legislation. (40) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes should be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on democracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. Such qualification should not extend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks or allocation of resources. 49 Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 60). 50 Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1). EN 29 EN (41) The fact that an AI system is classified as high risk under this Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is necessarily lawful under other acts of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the protection of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the emotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur solely in accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the applicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data, where relevant. (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on the Union market for users and affected persons, certain mandatory requirements should apply, taking into account the intended purpose of the use of the system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider. (43) Requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards the quality of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping, transparency and the provision of information to users, human oversight, and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively mitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights, as applicable in the light of the intended purpose of the system, and no other less trade restrictive measures are reasonably available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade. (44) High data quality is essential for the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become the source of discrimination prohibited by Union law. High quality training, validation and testing data sets require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Training, validation and testing data sets should be sufficiently relevant, representative and free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system. They should also have the appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. In particular, training, validation and testing data sets should take into account, to the extent required in the light of their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, behavioural or functional setting or context within which the AI system is intended to be used. In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the providers shouldbe able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest, in order to ensure the bias monitoring, detection and correction in relation to high-risk AI systems. (45) For the development of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use high quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance. Relevant competent authorities, EN 30 EN including sectoral ones, providing or supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. (46) Having information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform throughout their lifecycle is essential to verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation. This requires keeping records and the availability of a technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements. Such information should include the general characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk management system. The technical documentation should be kept up to date. (47) To address the opacity that may make certain AI systems incomprehensible to or too complex for natural persons, a certain degree of transparency should be required for high-risk AI systems. Users should be able to interpret the system output and use it appropriately. High-risk AI systems should therefore be accompanied by relevant documentation and instructions of use and include concise and clear information, including in relation to possible risks to fundamental rights and discrimination, where appropriate. (48) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons can oversee their functioning. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role. (49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. The level of accuracy and accuracy metrics should be communicated to the users. (50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be resilient against risks connected to the limitations of the system (e.g. errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations) as well as against malicious actions that may compromise the security of the AI system and result in harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system. (51) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure. EN 31 EN (52) As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing on the market, putting into service and use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council51 setting out the requirements for accreditation and the market surveillance of products, Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council52 on a common framework for the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council53 on market surveillance and compliance of products (‘New Legislative Framework for the marketing of products’). (53) It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes the responsibility for the placing on the market or putting into service of a high-risk AI system, regardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed or developed the system. (54) The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the accomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant documentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Public authorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own use may adopt and implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the quality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking into account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the public authority in question. (55) Where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which is covered by a relevant New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation is not placed on the market or put into service independently from the product, the manufacturer of the final product as defined under the relevant New Legislative Framework legislation should comply with the obligations of the provider established in this Regulation and notably ensure that the AI system embedded in the final product complies with the requirements of this Regulation. (56) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for operators, and taking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system. Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, where an importer cannot be identified, providers established outside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union. (57) In line with New Legislative Framework principles, specific obligations for relevant economic operators, such as importers and distributors, should be set to ensure legal certainty and facilitate regulatory compliance by those relevant operators. 51 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30). 52 Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision 93/465/EEC (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 82). 53 Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011 (Text with EEA relevance) (OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1–44). EN 32 EN (58) Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly associated with their use, including as regard the need to ensure proper monitoring of the performance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific responsibilities for users. Users should in particular use high-risk AI systems in accordance with the instructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with regard to monitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to record-keeping, as appropriate. (59) It is appropriate to envisage that the user of the AI system should be the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body under whose authority the AI system is operated except where the use is made in the course of a personal non\x02professional activity. (60) In the light of the complexity of the artificial intelligence value chain, relevant third parties, notably the ones involved in the sale and the supply of software, software tools and components, pre-trained models and data, or providers of network services, should cooperate, as appropriate, with providers and users to enable their compliance with the obligations under this Regulation and with competent authorities established under this Regulation. (61) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure compliance with this Regulation. Compliance with harmonised standards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council54 should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. However, the Commission could adopt common technical specifications in areas where no harmonised standards exist or where they are insufficient. (62) In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those systems should be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the market or putting into service. (63) It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing Union harmonisation legislation following the New Legislative Framework approach, the compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of the conformity assessment already foreseen under that legislation. The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant specific New Legislative Framework legislation. This approach is fully reflected in the interplay between this Regulation and the [Machinery Regulation]. While safety risks of AI systems ensuring safety functions in machinery are addressed by the requirements of this Regulation, certain specific requirements in the [Machinery Regulation] will ensure the safe integration of the AI system into the overall machinery, so as not to compromise the safety of the machinery as a whole. 54 Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12). EN 33 EN The [Machinery Regulation] applies the same definition of AI system as this Regulation. (64) Given the more extensive experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems intended to be used for the remote biometric identification of persons, for which the involvement of a notified body in the conformity assessment should be foreseen, to the extent they are not prohibited. (65) In order to carry out third-party conformity assessment for AI systems intended to be used for the remote biometric identification of persons, notified bodies should be designated under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided they are compliant with a set of requirements, notably on independence, competence and absence of conflicts of interests. (66) In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that an AI system undergoes a new conformity assessment whenever a change occurs which may affect the compliance of the system with this Regulation or when the intended purpose of the system changes. In addition, as regards AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service (i.e. they automatically adapt how functions are carried out), it is necessary to provide rules establishing that changes to the algorithm and its performance that have been pre-determined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment should not constitute a substantial modification. (67) High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles to the placing on the market or putting into service of high-risk AI systems that comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking. (68) Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for health and safety of persons and for society as a whole. It is thus appropriate that under exceptional reasons of public security or protection of life and health of natural persons and the protection of industrial and commercial property, Member States could authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems which have not undergone a conformity assessment. (69) In order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the artificial intelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public, providers of high-risk AI systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of relevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, should be required to register their high-risk AI system in a EU database, to be established and managed by the Commission. The Commission should be the controller of that database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the EN 34 EN Council55. In order to ensure the full functionality of the database, when deployed, the procedure for setting the database should include the elaboration of functional specifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. (70) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems. In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the circumstances and the context of use. Moreover, natural persons should be notified when they are exposed to an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system. Such information and notifications should be provided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. Further, users, who use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic, should disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin. (71) Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires novel forms of regulatory oversight and a safe space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that is innovation-friendly, future\x02proof and resilient to disruption, national competent authorities from one or more Member States should be encouraged to establish artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. (72) The objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation; to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the use of personal data collected for other purposes for developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, in line with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and without prejudice to Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. Participants in the sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent authorities, including by following their guidance and acting 55 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1). EN 35 EN expeditiously and in good faith to mitigate any high-risks to safety and fundamental rights that may arise during the development and experimentation in the sandbox. The conduct of the participants in the sandbox should be taken into account when competent authorities decide whether to impose an administrative fine under Article 83(2) of Regulation 2016/679 and Article 57 of Directive 2016/680. (73) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of small\x02scale providers and users of AI systems are taken into particular account. To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at those operators, including on awareness raising and information communication. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of small-scale providers shall be taken into account when Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. Translation costs related to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other operators, notably those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross\x02border users. (74) In order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers and notified bodies with their obligations under this Regulation, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member States at national or EU level should possibly contribute to the implementation of this Regulation. Within their respective mission and fields of competence, they may provide in particular technical and scientific support to providers and notified bodies. (75) It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to Testing and Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited pursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the context of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union harmonisation legislation. This is notably the case for expert panels, expert laboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746. (76) In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation a European Artificial Intelligence Board should be established. The Board should be responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including issuing opinions, recommendations, advice or guidance on matters related to the implementation of this Regulation, including on technical specifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in this Regulation and providing advice to and assisting the Commission on specific questions related to artificial intelligence. (77) Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In this respect, each Member State should designate one or more national competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the side of Member States and to set an official point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other counterparts at Member State and Union levels, in each Member State one national authority should be designated as national supervisory authority. (78) In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the EN 36 EN design and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. This system is also key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents or any breaches to national and Union law protecting fundamental rights resulting from the use of their AI systems. (79) In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and obligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the system of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Where necessary for their mandate, national public authorities or bodies, which supervise the application of Union law protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies, should also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. (80) Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk management rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course of provision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems. In order to ensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legislation, the authorities responsible for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services legislation, including where applicable the European Central Bank, should be designated as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions. To further enhance the consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council56, it is also appropriate to integrate the conformity assessment procedure and some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk management, post marketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on users of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU. (81) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Union. Providers of non-high-risk AI systems should be encouraged to create codes of conduct intended to foster the voluntary application of the mandatory requirements applicable to high-risk AI systems. Providers should also be encouraged to apply on a voluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to environmental sustainability, accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’ participation in the design and development of AI systems, and diversity of the development teams. The Commission may develop initiatives, including of a sectorial 56 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338). EN 37 EN nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical barriers hindering cross-border exchange of data for AI development, including on data access infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of data. (82) It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance with this Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out herein are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To contribute to this objective, the Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council57 would apply as a safety net. (83) In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on Union and national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks. (84) Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement. For certain specific infringements, Member States should take into account the margins and criteria set out in this Regulation. The European Data Protection Supervisor should have the power to impose fines on Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation. (85) In order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend the techniques and approaches referred to in Annex I to define AI systems, the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, the high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III, the provisions regarding technical documentation listed in Annex IV, the content of the EU declaration of conformity in Annex V, the provisions regarding the conformity assessment procedures in Annex VI and VII and the provisions establishing the high-risk AI systems to which the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical documentation should apply. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making58. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (86) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council59 . (87) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved 57 Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4). 58 OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1. 59 Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission\'s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p.13). EN 38 EN at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (88) This Regulation should apply from … [OP – please insert the date established in Art. 85]. However, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational before that date, therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure should apply from … [OP – please insert the date – three months following the entry into force of this Regulation]. In addition, Member States should lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore the provisions on penalties should apply from [OP – please insert the date – twelve months following the entry into force of this Regulation]. (89) The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board were consulted in accordance with Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on […]”.

TITLE III HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS CHAPTER 1 CLASSIFICATION OF AI SYSTEMS AS HIGH-RISK Article 6 Classification rules for high-risk AI systems 1. Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently from the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II; (b) the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II. 2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in Annex III shall also be considered high-risk. Article 7 Amendments to Annex III 1. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to update the list in Annex III by adding high-risk AI systems where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the AI systems are intended to be used in any of the areas listed in points 1 to 8 of Annex III; (b) the AI systems pose a risk of harm to the health and safety, or a risk of adverse impact on fundamental rights, that is, in respect of its severity and probability of occurrence, equivalent to or greater than the risk of harm or of adverse impact posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in Annex III. 2. When assessing for the purposes of paragraph 1 whether an AI system poses a risk of harm to the health and safety or a risk of adverse impact on fundamental rights that is equivalent to or greater than the risk of harm posed by the high-risk AI systems EN 46 EN already referred to in Annex III, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria: (a) the intended purpose of the AI system; (b) the extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used; (c) the extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to the health and safety or adverse impact on the fundamental rights or has given rise to significant concerns in relation to the materialisation of such harm or adverse impact, as demonstrated by reports or documented allegations submitted to national competent authorities; (d) the potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its intensity and its ability to affect a plurality of persons; (e) the extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are dependent on the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for practical or legal reasons it is not reasonably possible to opt-out from that outcome; (f) the extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are in a vulnerable position in relation to the user of an AI system, in particular due to an imbalance of power, knowledge, economic or social circumstances, or age; (g) the extent to which the outcome produced with an AI system is easily reversible, whereby outcomes having an impact on the health or safety of persons shall not be considered as easily reversible; (h) the extent to which existing Union legislation provides for: (i) effective measures of redress in relation to the risks posed by an AI system, with the exclusion of claims for damages; (ii) effective measures to prevent or substantially minimise those risks. CHAPTER 2 REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS Article 8 Compliance with the requirements 1. High-risk AI systems shall comply with the requirements established in this Chapter. 2. The intended purpose of the high-risk AI system and the risk management system referred to in Article 9 shall be taken into account when ensuring compliance with those requirements. Article 9 Risk management system 1. A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. 2. The risk management system shall consist of a continuous iterative process run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic updating. It shall comprise the following steps: EN 47 EN (a) identification and analysis of the known and foreseeable risks associated with each high-risk AI system; (b) estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse; (c) evaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 61; (d) adoption of suitable risk management measures in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs. 3. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interactions resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Chapter 2. They shall take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art, including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or common specifications. 4. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall be such that any residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged acceptable, provided that the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse. Those residual risks shall be communicated to the user. In identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured: (a) elimination or reduction of risks as far as possible through adequate design and development; (b) where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated; (c) provision of adequate information pursuant to Article 13, in particular as regards the risks referred to in paragraph 2, point (b) of this Article, and, where appropriate, training to users. In eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, training to be expected by the user and the environment in which the system is intended to be used. 5. High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purposes of identifying the most appropriate risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and they are in compliance with the requirements set out in this Chapter. 6. Testing procedures shall be suitable to achieve the intended purpose of the AI system and do not need to go beyond what is necessary to achieve that purpose. 7. The testing of the high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at any point in time throughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to the placing on the market or the putting into service. Testing shall be made against preliminarily defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system. EN 48 EN 8. When implementing the risk management system described in paragraphs 1 to 7, specific consideration shall be given to whether the high-risk AI system is likely to be accessed by or have an impact on children. 9. For credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU, the aspects described in paragraphs 1 to 8 shall be part of the risk management procedures established by those institutions pursuant to Article 74 of that Directive. Article 10 Data and data governance 1. High-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of models with data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that meet the quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5. 2.

Member States shall notify the list to the Commission and all other Member States and keep the list up to date. 5. Where the documentation referred to in paragraph 3 is insufficient to ascertain whether a breach of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights has occurred, the public authority or body referred to paragraph 3 may make a reasoned request to the market surveillance authority to organise testing of the high\x02risk AI system through technical means. The market surveillance authority shall organise the testing with the close involvement of the requesting public authority or body within reasonable time following the request. 6. Any information and documentation obtained by the national public authorities or bodies referred to in paragraph 3 pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in Article 70. Article 65 Procedure for dealing with AI systems presenting a risk at national level 1. AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a product presenting a risk defined in Article 3, point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 insofar as risks to the health or safety or to the protection of fundamental rights of persons are concerned. 2. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reasons to consider that an AI system presents a risk as referred to in paragraph 1, they shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. When risks to the protection of fundamental rights are present, the market surveillance authority shall also inform the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in Article 64(3). The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market EN 78 EN surveillance authorities and the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in Article 64(3). Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe. The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph. 3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the operator to take. 4. The operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. 5. Where the operator of an AI system does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in paragraph 2, the market surveillance authority shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system\'s being made available on its national market, to withdraw the product from that market or to recall it. That authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures. 6. The information referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant AI system, the origin of the AI system, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following: (a) a failure of the AI system to meet requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2; (b) shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in Articles 40 and 41 conferring a presumption of conformity. 7. The market surveillance authorities of the Member States other than the market surveillance authority of the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the AI system concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections. 8. Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 5, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. This is without prejudice to the procedural rights of the concerned operator in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. EN 79 EN 9. The market surveillance authorities of all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the product concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market, without delay. Article 66 Union safeguard procedure 1. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 65(5), objections are raised by a Member State against a measure taken by another Member State, or where the Commission considers the measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the relevant Member State and operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not within 9 months from the notification referred to in Article 65(5) and notify such decision to the Member State concerned. 2. If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant AI system is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure. 3. Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the AI system is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in Articles 40 and 41 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. Article 67 Compliant AI systems which present a risk 1. Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 65, the market surveillance authority of a Member State finds that although an AI system is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, to the compliance with obligations under Union or national law intended to protect fundamental rights or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the AI system concerned, when placed on the market or put into service, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the AI system from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe. 2. The provider or other relevant operators shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that they have made available on the market throughout the Union within the timeline prescribed by the market surveillance authority of the Member State referred to in paragraph 1. 3. The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the AI system concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the AI system, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken. 4. The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant operator and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis EN 80 EN of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures. 5. The Commission shall address its decision to the Member States. Article 68 Formal non-compliance 1. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant provider to put an end to the non\x02compliance concerned: (a) the conformity marking has been affixed in violation of Article 49; (b) the conformity marking has not been affixed; (c) the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up; (d) the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly; (e) the identification number of the notified body, which is involved in the conformity assessment procedure, where applicable, has not been affixed; 2. Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the Member State concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the high-risk AI system being made available on the market or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market. TITLE IX CODES OF CONDUCT Article 69 Codes of conduct 1. The Commission and the Member States shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to foster the voluntary application to AI systems other than high-risk AI systems of the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2 on the basis of technical specifications and solutions that are appropriate means of ensuring compliance with such requirements in light of the intended purpose of the systems. 2. The Commission and the Board shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to foster the voluntary application to AI systems of requirements related for example to environmental sustainability, accessibility for persons with a disability, stakeholders participation in the design and development of the AI systems and diversity of development teams on the basis of clear objectives and key performance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. 3.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative The Regulation should be fully applicable one year and a half after its adoption. However, elements of the governance structure should be in place before then. In particular, Member States shall have appointed existing authorities and/or established new authorities performing the tasks set out in the legislation earlier, and the EU AI Board should be set-up and effective. By the time of applicability, the European database of AI systems should be fully operative. In parallel to the adoption process, it is therefore necessary to develop the database, so that its development has come to an end when the regulation enters into force. 1.5.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point \'added value of Union involvement\' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. An emerging patchy framework of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the seamless provision of AI systems across the EU and is ineffective in ensuring the EN 94 EN safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values across the different Member States. A common EU legislative action on AI could boost the internal market and has great potential to provide European industry with a competitive edge at the global scene and economies of scale that cannot be achieved by individual Member States alone. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the functioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and sets a basic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member States, covering in principle all requirements applicable to digital services. The evaluation of the Directive pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of this cooperation mechanism, including important procedural aspects such as the lack of clear timeframes for response from Member States coupled with a general lack of responsiveness to requests from their counterparts. This has led over the years to a lack of trust between Member States in addressing concerns about providers offering digital services cross-border. The evaluation of the Directive showed the need to define a differentiated set of rules and requirements at European level. For this reason, the implementation of the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation would require a specific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a governance structure ensuring coordination of specific responsible bodies at EU level. 1.5.4. Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments The Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence and Amending Certain Union Legislative Acts defines a new common framework of requirements applicable to AI systems, which goes well beyond the framework provided by existing legislation. For this reason, a new national and European regulatory and coordination function needs to be established with this proposal. As regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments, the role of notifying authorities at national level can be performed by national authorities fulfilling similar functions sunder other EU regulations. Moreover, by increasing trust in AI and thus encouraging investment in development and adoption of AI, it complements Digital Europe, for which promoting the diffusion of AI is one of five priorities. 1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment The staff will be redeployed. The other costs will be supported from the DEP. envelope, given that the objective of this regulation – ensuring trustworthy AI – contributes directly to one key objective of Digital Europe – accelerating AI development and deployment in Europe.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. The Regulation will be reviewed and evaluated five years from the entry into force of the regulation. The Commission will report on the findings of the evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed The Regulation establishes a new policy with regard to harmonised rules for the provision of artificial intelligence systems in the internal market while ensuring the respect of safety and fundamental rights. These new rules require a consistency mechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations under this Regulation in the form of a new advisory group coordinating the activities of national authorities. In order to face these new tasks, it is necessary to appropriately resource the Commission’s services. The enforcement of the new Regulation is estimated to require 10 FTE à regime (5 FTE for the support to the activities of the Board and 5 FTE for the European Data Protection Supervisor acting as a notifying body for AI systems deployed by a body of the European Union). 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them In order to ensure that the members of the Board have the possibility to make informed analysis on the basis of factual evidence, it is foreseen that the Board should be supported by the administrative structure of the Commission and that an expert group be created to provide additional expertise where required. 2.2.3. Estimate and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of "control costs ÷ value of the related funds managed"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) For the meeting expenditure, given the low value per transaction (e.g. refunding travel costs for a delegate for a meeting), standard control procedures seem sufficient. Regarding the development of the database, contract attribution has a strong internal control system in place in DG CNECT through centralised procurement activities. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. The existing fraud prevention measures applicable to the Commission will cover the additional appropriations necessary for this Regulation. EN 97 EN 3.

"EN EN EUROPEAN COMMISSION Brussels, 21.4.2021 COM(2021) 206 final 2021/0106 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS {SEC(2021) 167 final} - {SWD(2021) 84 final} - {SWD(2021) 85 final} EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery, the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes and provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such action is especially needed in high-impact sectors, including climate change, environment and health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same elements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about new risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of technological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced approach. It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to ensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning according to Union values, fundamental rights and principles. This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who announced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission “A Union that strives for more”1 , that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on 19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach to excellence and trust2 . The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the twin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain uses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the development of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. The proposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other users the confidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop them. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being. Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise affecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that the technology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect of fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission launched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met with a great interest by a large number of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the challenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI. The proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the European Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a well-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both benefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level. It supports the objective of the Union being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial 1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission\_en.pdf 2 European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final, 2020. EN 2 EN intelligence as stated by the European Council3 and ensures the protection of ethical principles as specifically requested by the European Parliament4 . In 2017, the European Council called for a ‘sense of urgency to address emerging trends’ including ‘issues such as artificial intelligence …, while at the same time ensuring a high level of data protection, digital rights and ethical standards’5 . In its 2019 Conclusions on the Coordinated Plan on the development and use of artificial intelligence Made in Europe6 , the Council further highlighted the importance of ensuring that European citizens’ rights are fully respected and called for a review of the existing relevant legislation to make it fit for purpose for the new opportunities and challenges raised by AI. The European Council has also called for a clear determination of the AI applications that should be considered high-risk7 . The most recent Conclusions from 21 October 2020 further called for addressing the opacity, complexity, bias, a certain degree of unpredictability and partially autonomous behaviour of certain AI systems, to ensure their compatibility with fundamental rights and to facilitate the enforcement of legal rules8 . The European Parliament has also undertaken a considerable amount of work in the area of AI. In October 2020, it adopted a number of resolutions related to AI, including on ethics9 , liability10 and copyright11. In 2021, those were followed by resolutions on AI in criminal matters12 and in education, culture and the audio-visual sector13. The EP Resolution on a Framework of Ethical Aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Related Technologies specifically recommends to the Commission to propose legislative action to harness the opportunities and benefits of AI, but also to ensure protection of ethical principles. The resolution includes a text of the legislative proposal for a regulation on ethical principles for the development, deployment and use of AI, robotics and related technologies.

In that regard, the Commission has adopted the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027: Resetting education and training for the digital age, which foresees the development of ethical guidelines in AI and Data usage in education – Commission Communication COM(2020) 624 final. EN 3 EN proposal takes into account the aforementioned resolution of the European Parliament in full respect of proportionality, subsidiarity and better law making principles. Against this political context, the Commission puts forward the proposed regulatory framework on Artificial Intelligence with the following specific objectives:  ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values;  ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI;  enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems;  facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation. To achieve those objectives, this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal regulatory approach to AI that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address the risks and problems linked to AI, without unduly constraining or hindering technological development or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on the market. The proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework. On the one hand, it is comprehensive and future-proof in its fundamental regulatory choices, including the principle-based requirements that AI systems should comply with. On the other hand, it puts in place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well-defined risk-based regulatory approach that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade, whereby legal intervention is tailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the legal framework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge. The proposal sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems in the Union following a proportionate risk-based approach. It proposes a single future-proof definition of AI. Certain particularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as contravening Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in relation to certain uses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law enforcement. The proposal lays down a solid risk methodology to define “high-risk” AI systems that pose significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons. Those AI systems will have to comply with a set of horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI and follow conformity assessment procedures before those systems can be placed on the Union market. Predictable, proportionate and clear obligations are also placed on providers and users of those systems to ensure safety and respect of existing legislation protecting fundamental rights throughout the whole AI systems’ lifecycle. For some specific AI systems, only minimum transparency obligations are proposed, in particular when chatbots or ‘deep fakes’ are used. The proposed rules will be enforced through a governance system at Member States level, building on already existing structures, and a cooperation mechanism at Union level with the establishment of a European Artificial Intelligence Board. Additional measures are also proposed to support innovation, in particular through AI regulatory sandboxes and other measures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (‘SMEs’) and start-ups.

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The horizontal nature of the proposal requires full consistency with existing Union legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk AI systems are already used or likely to be used in the near future. Consistency is also ensured with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the existing secondary Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection, non-discrimination and gender equality. The proposal is without prejudice and complements the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) with a set of harmonised rules applicable to the design, development and use of certain high-risk AI systems and restrictions on certain uses of remote biometric identification systems. Furthermore, the proposal complements existing Union law on non-discrimination with specific requirements that aim to minimise the risk of algorithmic discrimination, in particular in relation to the design and the quality of data sets used for the development of AI systems complemented with obligations for testing, risk management, documentation and human oversight throughout the AI systems’ lifecycle. The proposal is without prejudice to the application of Union competition law. As regards high-risk AI systems which are safety components of products, this proposal will be integrated into the existing sectoral safety legislation to ensure consistency, avoid duplications and minimise additional burdens. In particular, as regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by the New Legislative Framework (NLF) legislation (e.g. machinery, medical devices, toys), the requirements for AI systems set out in this proposal will be checked as part of the existing conformity assessment procedures under the relevant NLF legislation. With regard to the interplay of requirements, while the safety risks specific to AI systems are meant to be covered by the requirements of this proposal, NLF legislation aims at ensuring the overall safety of the final product and therefore may contain specific requirements regarding the safe integration of an AI system into the final product. The proposal for a Machinery Regulation, which is adopted on the same day as this proposal fully reflects this approach. As regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by relevant Old Approach legislation (e.g. aviation, cars), this proposal would not directly apply. However, the ex-ante essential requirements for high-risk AI systems set out in this proposal will have to be taken into account when adopting relevant implementing or delegated legislation under those acts. As regards AI systems provided or used by regulated credit institutions, the authorities responsible for the supervision of the Union’s financial services legislation should be designated as competent authorities for supervising the requirements in this proposal to ensure a coherent enforcement of the obligations under this proposal and the Union’s financial services legislation where AI systems are to some extent implicitly regulated in relation to the internal governance system of credit institutions. To further enhance consistency, the conformity assessment procedure and some of the providers’ procedural obligations under this proposal are integrated into the procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision14 . 14 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC Text with EEA relevance, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338–436. EN 5 EN This proposal is also consistent with the applicable Union legislation on services, including on intermediary services regulated by the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC15 and the Commission’s recent proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA)16 . In relation to AI systems that are components of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice managed by the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA), the proposal will not apply to those AI systems that have been placed on the market or put into service before one year has elapsed from the date of application of this Regulation, unless the replacement or amendment of those legal acts leads to a significant change in the design or intended purpose of the AI system or AI systems concerned. 1.3. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is part of a wider comprehensive package of measures that address problems posed by the development and use of AI, as examined in the White Paper on AI. Consistency and complementarity is therefore ensured with other ongoing or planned initiatives of the Commission that also aim to address those problems, including the revision of sectoral product legislation (e.g. the Machinery Directive, the General Product Safety Directive) and initiatives that address liability issues related to new technologies, including AI systems. Those initiatives will build on and complement this proposal in order to bring legal clarity and foster the development of an ecosystem of trust in AI in Europe. The proposal is also coherent with the Commission’s overall digital strategy in its contribution to promoting technology that works for people, one of the three main pillars of the policy orientation and objectives announced in the Communication ‘Shaping Europe's digital future’17. It lays down a coherent, effective and proportionate framework to ensure AI is developed in ways that respect people’s rights and earn their trust, making Europe fit for the digital age and turning the next ten years into the Digital Decade18 . Furthermore, the promotion of AI-driven innovation is closely linked to the Data Governance Act19 , the Open Data Directive20 and other initiatives under the EU strategy for data21, which will establish trusted mechanisms and services for the re-use, sharing and pooling of data that are essential for the development of data-driven AI models of high quality. The proposal also strengthens significantly the Union’s role to help shape global norms and standards and promote trustworthy AI that is consistent with Union values and interests. It provides the Union with a powerful basis to engage further with its external partners, including third countries, and at international fora on issues relating to AI. 15 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ('Directive on electronic commerce'), OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1–16. 16 See Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) and amending Directive 2000/31/EC COM/2020/825 final. 17 Communication from the Commission, Shaping Europe's Digital Future, COM/2020/67 final. 18 2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade. 19 Proposal for a Regulation on European data governance (Data Governance Act) COM/2020/767. 20 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information, PE/28/2019/REV/1, OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56–83. 21 Commission Communication, A European strategy for data COM/2020/66 final. EN 6 EN 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY 2.1. Legal basis The legal basis for the proposal is in the first place Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the adoption of measures to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market. This proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market strategy. The primary objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by setting harmonised rules in particular on the development, placing on the Union market and the use of products and services making use of AI technologies or provided as stand-alone AI systems. Some Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. This will likely lead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of the internal market on essential elements regarding in particular the requirements for the AI products and services, their marketing, their use, the liability and the supervision by public authorities, and ii) the substantial diminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on how existing and new rules will apply to those systems in the Union. Given the wide circulation of products and services across borders, these two problems can be best solved through EU harmonizing legislation. Indeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and development of certain AI systems before they are placed on the market that will be further operationalised through harmonised technical standards. The proposal also addresses the situation after AI systems have been placed on the market by harmonising the way in which ex-post controls are conducted. In addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, notably restrictions of the use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. 2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which may be embedded in any product or service circulating freely within the internal market, entails that the objectives of this proposal cannot be effectively achieved by Member States alone. Furthermore, an emerging patchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the seamless circulation of products and services related to AI systems across the EU and will be ineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values across the different Member States. National approaches in addressing the problems will only create additional legal uncertainty and barriers, and will slow market uptake of AI. The objectives of this proposal can be better achieved at Union level to avoid a further fragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory national frameworks preventing the free circulation of goods and services embedding AI. A solid European regulatory framework for trustworthy AI will also ensure a level playing field and protect all people, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Only common action at Union level can also protect the Union’s digital sovereignty and leverage its tools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards. EN 7 EN 2.3. Proportionality The proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to achieve its objectives, since it follows a risk-based approach and imposes regulatory burdens only when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. For other, non-high-risk AI systems, only very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for example in terms of the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when interacting with humans. For high-risk AI systems, the requirements of high quality data, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness, are strictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that are not covered by other existing legal frameworks. Harmonised standards and supporting guidance and compliance tools will assist providers and users in complying with the requirements laid down by the proposal and minimise their costs. The costs incurred by operators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the economic and reputational benefits that operators can expect from this proposal. 2.4. Choice of the instrument The choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the prohibition of certain harmful AIenabled practices and the classification of certain AI systems. The direct applicability of a Regulation, in accordance with Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems. It will do so, in particular, by introducing a harmonised set of core requirements with regard to AI systems classified as high-risk and obligations for providers and users of those systems, improving the protection of fundamental rights and providing legal certainty for operators and consumers alike. At the same time, the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive and leave room for different levels of Member State action for elements that do not undermine the objectives of the initiative, in particular the internal organisation of the market surveillance system and the uptake of measures to foster innovation. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS 3.1. Stakeholder consultation This proposal is the result of extensive consultation with all major stakeholders, in which the general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission were applied. An online public consultation was launched on 19 February 2020 along with the publication of the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and ran until 14 June 2020. The objective of that consultation was to collect views and opinions on the White Paper. It targeted all interested stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including governments, local authorities, commercial and non-commercial organisations, social partners, experts, academics and citizens. After analysing all the responses received, the Commission published a summary outcome and the individual responses on its website22 . In total, 1215 contributions were received, of which 352 were from companies or business organisations/associations, 406 from individuals (92%individuals from EU ), 152 on behalf of 22 See all consultation results here. EN 8 EN academic/research institutions, and 73 from public authorities. Civil society’s voices were represented by 160 respondents (among which 9 consumers’ organisations, 129 nongovernmental organisations and 22 trade unions), 72 respondents contributed as ‘others’. Of the 352 business and industry representatives, 222 were companies and business representatives, 41.5% of which were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The rest were business associations. Overall, 84% of business and industry replies came from the EU27. Depending on the question, between 81 and 598 of the respondents used the free text option to insert comments. Over 450 position papers were submitted through the EU Survey website, either in addition to questionnaire answers (over 400) or as stand-alone contributions (over 50). Overall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on a need for action. A large majority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or that new legislation is needed. However, several stakeholders warn the Commission to avoid duplication, conflicting obligations and overregulation. There were many comments underlining the importance of a technology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework. Stakeholders mostly requested a narrow, clear and precise definition for AI. Stakeholders also highlighted that besides the clarification of the term of AI, it is important to define ‘risk’, ‘high-risk’, ‘low-risk’, ‘remote biometric identification’ and ‘harm’. Most of the respondents are explicitly in favour of the risk-based approach. Using a risk-based framework was considered a better option than blanket regulation of all AI systems. The types of risks and threats should be based on a sector-by-sector and case-by-case approach. Risks also should be calculated taking into account the impact on rights and safety. Regulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of AI and are welcomed by certain stakeholders, especially the Business Associations. Among those who formulated their opinion on the enforcement models, more than 50%, especially from the business associations, were in favour of a combination of an ex-ante risk self-assessment and an ex-post enforcement for high-risk AI systems. 3.2. Collection and use of expertise The proposal builds on two years of analysis and close involvement of stakeholders, including academics, businesses, social partners, non-governmental organisations, Member States and citizens. The preparatory work started in 2018 with the setting up of a High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) which had an inclusive and broad composition of 52 well-known experts tasked to advise the Commission on the implementation of the Commission’s Strategy on Artificial Intelligence. In April 2019, the Commission supported23 the key requirements set out in the HLEG ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI24, which had been revised to take into account more than 500 submissions from stakeholders. The key requirements reflect a widespread and common approach, as evidenced by a plethora of ethical codes and principles developed by many private and public organisations in Europe and beyond, that AI development and use should be guided by certain essential value-oriented principles. The Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)25 made those requirements operational in a piloting process with over 350 organisations. 23 European Commission, Building Trust in Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence, COM(2019) 168. 24 HLEG, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, 2019. 25 HLEG, Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) for self-assessment, 2020. EN 9 EN In addition, the AI Alliance26 was formed as a platform for approximately 4000 stakeholders to debate the technological and societal implications of AI, culminating in a yearly AI Assembly. The White Paper on AI further developed this inclusive approach, inciting comments from more than 1250 stakeholders, including over 450 additional position papers. As a result, the Commission published an Inception Impact Assessment, which in turn attracted more than 130 comments 27 . Additional stakeholder workshops and events were also organised the results of which support the analysis in the impact assessment and the policy choices made in this proposal28. An external study was also procured to feed into the impact assessment. 3.3. Impact assessment In line with its “Better Regulation” policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment for this proposal examined by the Commission's Regulatory Scrutiny Board. A meeting with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was held on 16 December 2020, which was followed by a negative opinion. After substantial revision of the impact assessment to address the comments and a resubmission of the impact assessment, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on 21 March 2021. The opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, the recommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account are presented in Annex 1 of the impact assessment. The Commission examined different policy options to achieve the general objective of the proposal, which is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market by creating the conditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI in the Union. Four policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessed:  Option 1: EU legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling scheme;  Option 2: a sectoral, “ad-hoc” approach;  Option 3: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approach;  Option 3+: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approach + codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems;  Option 4: Horizontal EU legislative instrument establishing mandatory requirements for all AI systems, irrespective of the risk they pose. According to the Commission's established methodology, each policy option was evaluated against economic and societal impacts, with a particular focus on impacts on fundamental rights. The preferred option is option 3+, a regulatory framework for high-risk AI systems only, with the possibility for all providers of non-high-risk AI systems to follow a code of conduct. The requirements will concern data, documentation and traceability, provision of information and transparency, human oversight and robustness and accuracy and would be mandatory for high-risk AI systems. Companies that introduced codes of conduct for other AI systems would do so voluntarily. 26 The AI Alliance is a multi-stakeholder forum launched in June 2018, AI Alliance https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-ai-alliance 27 European Commission, Inception Impact Assessment For a Proposal for a legal act of the European Parliament and the Council laying down requirements for Artificial Intelligence. 28 For details of all the consultations that have been carried out see Annex 2 of the impact assessment. EN 10 EN The preferred option was considered suitable to address in the most effective way the objectives of this proposal. By requiring a restricted yet effective set of actions from AI developers and users, the preferred option limits the risks of violation of fundamental rights and safety of people and foster effective supervision and enforcement, by targeting the requirements only to systems where there is a high risk that such violations could occur. As a result, that option keeps compliance costs to a minimum, thus avoiding an unnecessary slowing of uptake due to higher prices and compliance costs. In order to address possible disadvantages for SMEs, this option includes several provisions to support their compliance and reduce their costs, including creation of regulatory sandboxes and obligation to consider SMEs interests when setting fees related to conformity assessment. The preferred option will increase people’s trust in AI, companies will gain in legal certainty, and Member States will see no reason to take unilateral action that could fragment the single market. As a result of higher demand due to higher trust, more available offers due to legal certainty, and the absence of obstacles to cross-border movement of AI systems, the single market for AI will likely flourish. The European Union will continue to develop a fastgrowing AI ecosystem of innovative services and products embedding AI technology or stand-alone AI systems, resulting in increased digital autonomy. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use AI applications that constitute a high risk for the safety or fundamental rights of citizens would have to comply with specific requirements and obligations. Compliance with these requirements would imply costs amounting to approximately EUR € 6000 to EUR € 7000 for the supply of an average highrisk AI system of around EUR € 170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the annual cost for the time spent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate, depending on the use case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR € 5000 to EUR € 8000 per year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR € 3000 to EUR € 7500 for suppliers of high-risk AI. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use any AI applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information. However, they could choose to join others and together adopt a code of conduct to follow suitable requirements, and to ensure that their AI systems are trustworthy. In such a case, costs would be at most as high as for high-risk AI systems, but most probably lower. The impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders (economic operators/ business; conformity assessment bodies, standardisation bodies and other public bodies; individuals/citizens; researchers) are explained in detail in Annex 3 of the Impact assessment supporting this proposal. 3.4. Regulatory fitness and simplification This proposal lays down obligation that will apply to providers and users of high-risk AI systems. For providers who develop and place such systems on the Union market, it will create legal certainty and ensure that no obstacle to the cross-border provision of AI-related services and products emerge. For companies using AI, it will promote trust among their customers. For national public administrations, it will promote public trust in the use of AI and strengthen enforcement mechanisms (by introducing a European coordination mechanism, providing for appropriate capacities, and facilitating audits of the AI systems with new requirements for documentation, traceability and transparency). Moreover, the framework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation, including regulatory sandboxes and specific measures supporting small-scale users and providers of high-risk AI systems to comply with the new rules. The proposal also specifically aims at strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral Union legislation applicable to EN 11 EN AI systems (e.g. on products and services) that will bring further clarity and simplify the enforcement of the new rules. 3.5. Fundamental rights The use of AI with its specific characteristics (e.g. opacity, complexity, dependency on data, autonomous behaviour) can adversely

"hey guys so in today\'s video we are going over 27 profitable businesses that you can start during a recession this video is going to be unlike others because I\'m actually going to dive a little bit deeper into how to start each of these businesses as well as the exact game plan I would take I\'ll also give you guys some resources that you guys check out so that you can learn more about each of these business types yeah overall every business on this list is one that I think has massive potential yeah if you\'re an aspiring entrepreneur this is the perfect time to get started so without further Ado let\'s get started the first business we\'re talking about today is bookkeeping this business should be able to pay anywhere from 19 to 30 per hour or more now a lot of people think that bookkeeping is extremely hard to get into but it\'s actually not for those of you that might not know bookkeeping is the process of recording the financial transactions of a company so what did the company buy what did the company sell Etc and what\'s so great about this job is that certification is actually not required however to make yourself a more marketable and attractive bookkeeper for smaller businesses a great game plan to follow is to start taking free online courses and then leveraging that knowledge in a formal online certification course you guys can start small by posting your work on freelance websites like Fiverr upwork showing that you are a talented and reliable bookkeeper the more work you do the more opportunities you\'ll get from bigger and bigger businesses and yeah eventually you can provide bookkeeping services for multiple clients at the same time now the pay for bookkeepers can actually vary wildly I\'ve seen bookkeepers be paid up to a hundred dollars per hour and just really is based on the experience as well as the demand for your services I recently saw a video posted by the YouTube channel called realistic bookkeeping and she said that her pay as an amateur bookkeeper is closer to the 30 to 35 dollars per hour range but she knows that time and experience can definitely get her paid closer to sixty dollars per hour or more there are tons and tons of entrepreneurs small businesses and corporations looking for bookkeepers especially with the Boom in entrepreneurship right now and yeah I really like it because it is outsourceable at some point you can leverage with building a team but also the fact is that you can work anywhere you want which is amazing next up is becoming a content creator so as a content creator you really have no ceiling when it comes to pay look at YouTube creators like PewDiePie or Mr Beast who each have 100 million subscribers on their channels and easily make millions of dollars per month on their videos as a content creator myself a much smaller one I can tell you that it is incredibly satisfying to own a business that is based on your own creative freedom plus it can pay extremely well even if you don\'t have millions of subscribers I\'ll say that it is very hard to build an audience at first but here\'s some actionable steps you can take to launch your content creation career first find a marketable niche with an audience that is large enough to grow but not so large that there are already thousands of other content creators doing the same thing as you next you\'re gonna have to set an actual reasonable plan for creating your content how often will you post do you want to do quality or do you want equality and yeah any technical knowledge gaps can be addressed on YouTube the thing is to stay consistent and be passionate about what you\'re talking about now with my main YouTube channel I\'m able to make over two million dollars per year just by monetizing it and yeah I think a lot of people don\'t realize how profitable YouTube and content creation can be what I would do if I was starting out is make a ton of videos on YouTube shorts on Tick Tock and on Instagram gram reels because all these you can basically create one video and repost it onto all different platforms after that start making long-form content create a catalog of Evergreen videos and then start focusing on more trending topics and yeah just stay at this consistently for a long long time eventually you\'ll be able to monetize using affiliate marketing by selling your own courses as well as YouTube AdSense and doing sponsorships the potential is actually literally Limitless with this and I really do think it\'s one of the best jobs in the world okay number three is being a social media manager this business should usually net you between 14 to 35 dollars per hour but of course pay can vary depending on who you work for so as a social media manager the job description is in the name you will basically be managing the social media of your clients and to successfully build a business you need to have a solid understanding of social media including the platforms the trends and the statistics start by building your own knowledge base and skill set when it comes to social media try running a theme page or a small YouTube channel as you can never run out of ideas here take courses or watch online videos breaking down how influencers build and maintain audiences on platforms like Instagram solely add accomplishments certifications and experiences to your resume and then approach small businesses who you think are suffering or can be improved in these social media departments and advertise your work and your skills as long as you can bring value when it comes to publicizing a business you\'ll definitely be needed somewhere and there are so many possibilities for this type of business Jordan Quinn for example is a Canadian influencer who owns an agency business called social IQ that specializes in marketing branding and web development geared especially towards assisting or managing the online platforms of parenting bloggers now whether it be parenting bloggers cooking businesses or entrepreneurs there is plenty of freedom in the work you can do as a social media manager and of course the pay is not limited to what I said earlier you can absolutely build an entire agency around this and make six seven or even eight figures per year yeah you guys know social media is blowing up even more and this is really the perfect time to get into this industry all right the next one we\'re talking about is a little bit different and this is a lawn mowing business now with a lawn mowing business you can usually earn 40 to 50 dollars per lawn as a reasonable starting pay however this business has quite a bit of room to grow and you can definitely build your business into a company that can net you way more over time take for instance Brian\'s lawn maintenance which is a lawn care business started by Brian Fullerton in 2007 that is now both a lawn care business and an online resource for other entrepreneurs they have a website a YouTube channel an Instagram profile and online course that have all amassed hundreds of thousands of followers and users the beauty of a lawn mowing business is that the startup cost is cheap and it\'s relatively easy to get started all you need is some Capital to buy the proper equipment which will include the lawnmower the string trimmer the leaf blower other tools and protective gear don\'t forget about how you will transport these tools too so you may need to track instead of using your own car or if just doing neighbors you could probably just wheel around your equipment once you have all that sorted you can start reaching out to neighbors and local residents to see if their lawns need trimming they\'ll schedule for your operations so you can manage several clients at the same time if you really want to get organized you can legalize your lawn care business into a legitimate operation especially when you start are hiring others to help you I personally love this business idea because it\'s a great idea where you can really get started at any age if you\'re in middle school or high school this is really a perfect business and I do consider it a pretty high value skill next up is being a freelance writer so this job can usually earn you between 50 to 200 per script with plenty of room to grow and if you really want to see how far you can go with your freelance writing business definitely look into the career and Rise of Alex fasulo who\'s a freelance writer who largely operates on Fiverr and as of today has made over 1.5 million dollars on the platform alone I actually interviewed here on my channel not too long ago so if you want to learn more feel free to check out that video yeah what I would do is research the freelance writing industry what our successful writers doing and once you\'ve gauged the market you can then build your own business and skill set if you feel like you struggle with writing consider taking an online course to help improve your grammar and syntax and to also learn how to write four businesses you\'re catering to for example book publishers and YouTubers each incorporate very different styles of writing and so you should figure out where your strengths are in writing what I would do is I I would spend one to two months learning the whole process of writing for whatever Niche you picked for example if you want to you know get into writing YouTube scripts watch a lot of YouTube videos build out a system for writing your scripts and then build up a portfolio with that portfolio you can now reach out to YouTubers or whoever else you\'re targeting and offer to write them a free script if you crush it on that free script I guarantee you they\'re going to come back for more yeah one of the great things about freelance writing is that you can actually Outsource some of the work you can Outsource some of the research you can actually Outsource all of the writing itself yeah over time it\'s actually become a very big agency you\'ll do all the writing at first but then later you\'ll train people to write with the same style and with that you\'ll have a lot of Leverage overall a super cool business that you can start from anywhere and I really do think that the demand for these types of writers is blowing up now the next business that you guys can start is e-commerce eCommerce is the purchase and sale of goods online and any e-commerce business has virtually unlimited potential for growth and wealth Warby Parker for instance is an online retailer of eyewear that started off as a small e-commerce business and now found on the New York Stock Exchange you can think of this type of business as opening an online store so here\'s the game plan that I would take you first need to choose a product to sell to do this you can research the market and find a niche that strikes a balance between being relatively uncompetitive while also targeting a large enough audience make sure to research the cost of supply and also begin to see what other costs there are so that you can calculate your profits then you\'ll choose an e-commerce platform to sell on there\'s Shopify there\'s Amazon FBA really the list is endless with the platforms and what I would do is I\'d actually either get a mentor or learn everything yourself on YouTube of course there are so many different types of e-commerce businesses so I know this can be a pretty General broad topic we have the most important thing is that your product is actually a little bit different than other people\'s products that you\'re not viewed as a commodity because this is really going to drive down your price as well as your profits instead do something a little bit different funnel things up change something that other people in reviews are saying could be worked on you sort of get my point right like make your product better or different than others from there on you\'ll want to build reviews you\'ll want to work out your Logistics and most importantly you just want to get started yes the e-commerce business can take some time and money to start growing but it\'s an online store this is in my opinion way better than a physical location store because you can sell to the entire world yeah super awesome business that you can do from anywhere and I personally know so many really successful e-commerce sellers you can also build a business build equity in it and sell at some point and that can net you a lot of money all right so next up is affiliate marketing and the money you can make from affiliate marketing is highly variable and largely depends on the size of your audience if you don\'t know affiliate marketing is a form of marketing where businesses reward you the affiliate for every visitor or customer that you bring I myself use affiliate marketing with my content by attaching affiliate links to the descriptions of my videos now get a commission for every viewer that actually clicks on that link and buys something now to get into affiliate marketing you can start on any platform whether it be Instagram YouTube Tick Tock or some other social media site I\'ll say the first step and the hardest step is to actually build an audience with your content there are different ways of doing this depending on your choice of platform but the the one thing that applies to anyone who wants to build an audience is to provide value and to be consistent with that value this means finding a niche that is not too competitive or a niche where you\'re actually highly knowledgeable yeah so for example I make a ton of content about let\'s say investing and within those investing videos I\'ll have links to you know stock platforms and when people click on those links and sign up I do actually get a small commission so yeah what you want to do is build up that audience first and then you can join affiliate marketing platforms like share sale Commission Junction or impact radius these platforms have tons and tons of companies on there who are looking for the affiliate marketers like you join those programs and then start making content that align with those products or services and I guarantee you the earning potential for this is pretty much unlimited you guys can do this on social media you guys can do blogs you guys can do newsletters there\'s so many creative ways you can get into affiliate marketing and of course the great thing is that it\'s all online based you don\'t need to be in a physical location yeah it\'s highly leveraged because you know your audience is all over the world there are billions of people yeah that\'s how I\'ve been able to make over a hundred thousand dollars per month in passive income through affiliate marketing and also think that is you know somewhat the low end there are people making way more money than that so really cool business with very very high earning potential okay the next business we\'re talking about is just starting up any type of agency an agency is simply a company that provides specific services so they can do things like assist with web development social media marketing influencer marketing and other highly valuable skills because an agency can be such a scalable business the money that you can make from starting one can go as high as you know six seven eight even nine figures and yeah take a look at a company like omnicon group which is a New York based advertising agency that now generates billions of dollars of Revenue a year there\'s unlimited potential with starting an agency so yeah first things first determine your Niche your agency will have to specialize in something and realizing what you want to specialize in can help you do research into your industry your client markets and your competition choose a niche that you are knowledgeable about and that you are good at after that you\'re going to want to decide whether or not you want to make your agency remote doesn\'t actually really reduce your startup costs and enable flexibility for your business as well as your workers this also May mean that you can charge lower prices get more customers and just have lower overhead overall because of course if you\'re fully remote you can you know hire people from different countries that\'s probably a lot less expensive than hiring people just in the states or wherever you are after that you\'re going to want to decide on a business model for your agency to run on for example you need to decide whether your services should be paid on a flat rate on commission or on hourly rate once you have a pretty good idea of what you want your agency to be start hiring people to help you or work for you start small maybe you can actually fulfill all the work yourself at first and then after you get a client base that\'s when you can make your first hire now the hardest part about your agency is of course you know pulling out good work but beyond that it\'s going to be marketing and getting clients what I recommend doing is get on social media offer a lot of value to your target audience these are the people that would actually you know hire you in the future yeah if you can build trust with that and provide so much free value it\'s very likely that they will actually come to you for your paid Services you can also do direct Outreach to different companies and yeah you can get very very creative with how you get new clients overall this is a really cool business that can create a lot of cash flow for yourself okay next up is website development so this is a business that should be able to pay between 80 to 100 per hour or more websites are like virtual real estate and at this point they\'re always going to be in demand the great thing is that yes you can become an actual web developer but there are so many platforms now that allow you to build websites without any coding experience so I really do think that the learning curve for this is a lot smaller than it was before the first thing you\'re going to want to do is teach yourself how to build a website and yeah like I said it\'s actually not as hard as it might seem watch YouTube videos maybe get some courses and most importantly just practice a lot and build up your portfolio I recommend platforms like webflow WordPress Squarespace hostinger Wix really the list is endless after that you\'re going to want to reach out to people who may need websites so you can get really creative with this right you can Target entrepreneurs you can Target YouTubers you can Target twitch streamers really just choose a niche and then stick with that I really really recommend you guys don\'t just make General websites for everyone focus on one particular Niche get really good at that have your entire portfolio you know very specialized and I guarantee you that\'s going to make your conversion rates a lot higher when getting new clients there\'s gonna be a lot of Outreach needed but as you build up your client base and you know give them really really good results they\'re going to refer you to the people that they know and I guarantee your business is going to blow up like in a good way overall this is a very great high value skill that can be done just from your laptop I definitely think it\'s one of the perfect businesses that you guys can start during a recession or really any time okay next up is becoming a graphic designer so with graphic design you can actually make a lot of money I\'d estimate anywhere between 30 to 100 per hour businesses always need graphic designers to design logos Flyers advertisements emails and any other form of marketing while it takes a bit of time to actually build your own skills and experience in this realm of business I can see this business doing extremely well once you get the hang of things your Universal game plan as a graphic design minor is to just continually build your portfolio start learning watch a ton of videos buy some courses and do think that you can build up some really great skills within one to two months if you can start to focus on a particular Niche and then start finding your first client your first clients are going to be so important because this is where you\'re going to learn more about the business and if you can really deliver to these clients they\'re going to tell their friends and you have the word of mouth for you know graphic design is very very big this can turn into a full-time agency if you have enough clients and overall it\'s just a very high value skill you can do from your computer and it\'s really a skill that a lot of people can learn just from home if I were interested in graphic design I think now would be a perfect time to get into this business okay so the next business that you guys can start is becoming a thumbnail creator for YouTubers so as a thumbnail Creator you can expect to make between five to let\'s say a hundred dollars per thumbnail what I recommend doing is study some of the best thumbnails that are on YouTube see what makes certain thumbnails perform really well and then start building up your own portfolio like many other businesses on this list this can be done fully remotely and the biggest challenge for this is to one get good of course but also to find clients so how I would approach this as a YouTuber who has a ton of people reaching out to me asking if they can make my thumbnails is to just you know offer free value at the start this is going to you know instantly separate yourself from everyone else that\'s reaching out and yeah if you can make them a really solid free thumbnail I guarantee you they\'re going to come back because thumbnails are extremely important if you don\'t want to get started that way you can actually just start going on Fiverr or upwork you\'ll generally probably make a bit less on those platforms but that will allow you to build up a portfolio overall I think this business has so much potential because you know more and more people are getting onto YouTube more and more people are realizing just how important these thumbnails are and so yeah if you can become one of the best thumbnail makers I really do think that this can become a six-figure business next up is starting a tick tock video editing agency so I\'ll need to convince you that Tick Tock is one of the biggest social media Platforms in the world we\'ve all seen this influence on today\'s media and culture and yeah consequently more and more people are joining and creating content on there there\'s a certain style and feel to tick tock videos that can definitely be emulated which is why I think a viable business idea that you can definitely try is to start a tick tock generating agency if you watch videos on Tick Tock you\'d recognize that a lot of the high performing videos are fast-paced quick cut style and yeah if you know that then you can easily make great videos for your clients the people that I would actually Target with this type of business is entrepreneurs and people that are trying to start up their personal brand there are so many people that create long-form videos on YouTube but they don\'t have a way to sort of cut those down and post them onto Tick Tock shorts or Instagram reels so that\'s basically where you\'re going to come in right you\'re basically going to identify people that are already making a lot of long-form content and then reach out to them offering to make them a few free pieces of short form videos Crusher doing that and I guarantee you they are going to come back the great thing is that you can charge note 30 to 100 per Tick Tock video you make and yeah first you can fulfill this yourself but at some point you can actually hire editors to do this for you you can easily find a video editors overseas train them to have a specific editing style for tick tock and then be able to use them to leverage your time this is a super great way to get into the content industry yeah I really think that as more and more entrepreneurs and businesses start building up their social media they\'ll realize hey we need people that are really good at making these Tick Tock videos and that\'s why the demand for this is going to pick up a lot definitely a very interesting business that I recommend starting out the next business is buying and selling domains so as we\'ve already talked about businesses and companies will always need websites for their businesses and every website needs a domain name that is simple and memorable this is where buying and reselling domains can be a profitable business idea for you first think of some niches that you\'re really familiar with because then you\'ll have a better understanding of the values of certain domain names over others next you should check the availability of some domain names that you\'ve thought of a great place to check is just going to be like GoDaddy or namecheap and yeah they\'re even going to list prices for pre-existing domain names that are already taken compare the price of your chosen domain name with other similar domains on namebio.com and buy once you feel confident in this domain name and its price afterwards choose a great platform to put your domain name in front of the buyer\'s market and then wait for a buyer to come in I recently read a great article about a man named Rick Schwartz a self-proclaimed domain King who\'s made millions of dollars registering and selling domains to massive clients including CNN of course this took him a lot of time but you can definitely see the potential here you can also sell your domain names on social media and yeah I think the Big Technical skill here is identifying which names have not yet been taken but have a lot of potential buying them for like five to ten dollars a year and then securing the right buyers another way to do this is you\'ll buy domains create logos for them and then make some type of website platform selling these brand identities so for example let\'s say the domain name thebrownchicken.com is available I\'d buy that I\'d make some type of logo for it and I\'d package that together and sell it to people that want to start a company within that Niche I actually think this is really smart because people are way more likely to buy a domain if they see it packaged with some type of logo and yeah there are some companies out there doing this but if you can do this yourself I think that can be an amazing business idea the next business we\'re talking about is website remodeling slash SEO on top of domain names company websites constantly need to be remodeled and optimized for users as well as search engines this is a fundamental part of doing business online and so a lot of website remodelers SEO Consultants are constantly in demand to get started with this business you will definitely have to understand the basics of web design while also researching the ins and outs of search engine optimization or SEO there are plenty of Awesome videos online and if you wanted to go deeper take some online courses this is going to take a lot of time dedication because SEO is highly important and requires a significantly larger knowledge base than a lot of the other businesses on this list once you\'re comfortable with the fundamentals of optimization start assembling a portfolio of ideas that you want to provide for your clients so let\'s say for example you guys want to set up an SEO service right so search engine optimization for businesses well absolutely recommend doing is niching down and focusing on specific Industries the last thing you want to do is become an SEO company that you know focuses on all types of companies instead you\'re going to want to focus on one particular industry and focus on SEO Services only for those types of businesses you might think okay that\'s gonna you know make it so that I can\'t work with that many businesses but it\'s going to be the exact opposite if you\'re very specialized with your services then I guarantee you more and more people are going to be inclined to use you versus someone else that\'s more General because of course you are specialized why would they not after that offer your SEO services for friends maybe find some small businesses around you or that are online and slowly build up your Client List focus a lot of time and money on your actual delivery because that\'s what\'s going to you know make you have returning customers and that\'s what\'s going to make them actually refer you to other businesses I think SEO is a skill that a lot of people have zero clue about but it\'s also one that you can learn in a relatively short amount of time overall it\'s one of the best high value skills I think anyone can learn and if you want to create a business that\'s fully remote notes fully based online this is going to be one of the best ones that you can start the next business you can start is becoming a copywriter so a copywriter writes the text that is used for advertising products or Services it\'s a critical aspect of marketing right slogans like just do it are what make companies like Nike so Unforgettable this is why copywriters are so important to businesses and why copywriting is such a recession-proof high value skill the first important thing to note is that there are no educational requirements to becoming a really good copywriter however what I recommend doing is actually start learning online perhaps get some type of online certification for copywriting and then build up that resume if you want to build up your resume but don\'t have any people to write for you could definitely consider completing a copywriting internship this can definitely help you gain experience as well as network with the right people in a similar space as you but yeah if you want to skip that I recommend just get good at copywriting offer the service to your friends into small businesses and offer to write them some free or discounted copy start small and your copywriting as it helps more and more businesses will will justify your value you can also get started on Fiverr and upwork but those are generally going to pay you a bit less and I think that for most people the best way to get started is like I said reach out to businesses and people fulfill these Services yourself on your own and at some point start hiring people to do the writing for you it\'s absolutely a skill that you can train other people to have and that\'s why this can turn into a massive scalable business that resembles an agency copywriting is another really really great high value skill that I think everyone should have and that\'s why it has the potential to make a lot of money and turn into a full-on agency the next business we\'re talking about is getting into sales and I know this is a very broad category but that\'s because there are so many possibilities here obviously companies will always need people to sell their products and services if you feel like sales is the business you want to take on then these companies will always need people like you now the type of business that I personally would start in sales is create some type of agency where you find Setters teach them how to sell High ticket products and then put those Setters within other businesses the reason why this is so cool is because you you can actually you know train people to become good sales people and then these companies who are looking for people to sell their High ticket products will often pay between let\'s say five to ten thousand dollars per person and yeah this is just a placement fee you guys they\'ll literally pay your company five to ten thousand dollars to make the intro to someone that you have trained and put that person within their company you guys can probably see why this is so scalable it\'s because you can basically create some type of system teaching people how to become great sales people enroll them in that course that you\'ve created and if it works then you\'ll have a ton of great sales people that other businesses are really going to want to have within their company do this and then reach out to businesses that sell High tickets programs and then offer to place your Setters within their company this is a super high margin business that can be done from anywhere I really think it\'s in an industry a niche that is blowing up okay number 17 is becoming a virtual assistant there\'s so many companies and entrepreneurs out there that need a lot of things done including scheduling appointments arranging travel making phone calls or organizing inbox these tasks can eat up a lot of productive time so what these people will often do is hire virtual assistants to do these tasks for them now this is probably one of the lower paying jobs on this list but it can be done from anywhere you can build up a lot of valuable skills yeah it\'s really not one of those jobs that you\'ll probably do forever but it\'s such a great way to get into the online space and start making money from home just from your laptop you\'ll probably want to have some skills like being good at Microsoft Office Excel whatever it is but for most people they\'re going to learn a lot of these skills while on the job the great thing is that you don\'t need to have a degree you just need to be hard working and you need to be able to actually you know take on a lot of tasks and be able to sort of multitask if you\'re good at this then I think you can become an awesome virtual assistant and yeah if you\'re in the States you can probably charge between 15 to 30 an hour and eventually you may even be able to create some type of virtual assistant company or platform where you set up virtual assistants with other entrepreneurs you guys can get really creative with this industry but I really do think that there are so many people that are going to be looking to hire virtual assistance within the next five to ten years and you can either be the virtual assistant yourself or you can be the one to actually find virtual assistants train them and then place them within other companies number 18 is just going to be freelancing on a platform like Fiverr or upwork you guys have already heard me talk about these platforms but I think during a recession especially right now becoming a freelancer is such a good way to make money online it\'s a business that doesn\'t really cost any money to start since it is service based you know that\'s why I think anyone watching this video can pretty much immediately start by identifying a skill they have listing that skill on a platform like Fiverr upwork and then start freelancing some type of specific service what I\'ll do is take a look at Fiverr and upwork marketplaces and see what types of services people are offering this can help you brainstorm and identify what types of skills you have that you can actually you know sell or offer as a service and yeah if you look online there are some people doing really creative things such as singing happy birthday for clients along with pretty much anything you can think of then you\'ll want to create your own Fiverr or upwork accounts now there are plenty of online tutorials and articles that can help you actually optimize your accounts and your listings list your services online provide quality work and then the reviews will speak for themselves yes this is going to take some time to build up but once you\'ve developed enough traction and reputation freelance work on these sites can actually become a very very big source of your income if you guys can get selected for Fiverr Pro that\'s immediately going to make your business take off do everything you can to satisfy your customers and clients get those five star reviews at some point you will be able to get selected for Fiverr Pro overall I just want to sort of separate and create this independent category for Fiverr or upwork because I think freelancing is such a great business that anyone can start and if you want to get into entrepreneurship this is one of the best ways to do that online next up is selling an online course so people are always hungry for knowledge and education especially when it comes to learning new skill sets or subjects and yeah as you guys probably know there are many things that are not taught in schools one of the most lucrative business ideas that you guys can start today is actually developing marketing and selling an online course for a desirable skill that teaches people how to make money money the first thing you\'re going to do of course is to identify a skill that you can teach what I recommend doing is find a way to you know connect that skill to making money the best courses that are the most profitable teach people how to make money in any certain way develop some type of system create some type of video course packaging everything you know into let\'s say a 10 to 20 hour course and then use a platform like kajabi teachable thinkific whatever to host that course there are so many resources that you guys can check out to you know actually learn what makes a course good and what makes a course profitable and so yeah if this resonates with you I definitely recommend doing more research but overall the whole industry of online courses is growing I think education is slowly shifting from you know more general education to very specific skills and online courses are the best way for that shift to happen the great thing is that the margins are extremely high but of course it does take a lot of time to initially create that course the game plan that I would personally do is first figure out if there\'s demand for the idea you have you can pre-sell your course and if there\'s good interest then you can actually you know start making your course I\'d say that typically a course will take you between two to four weeks to create if you\'re doing this full time and so yeah you\'ll want to make sure that the demand is there before you actually invest that much time into it you can either go low ticket and create cheaper courses between 10 to let\'s say 100 each or it can go more High ticket and sell courses that are between let\'s say three to ten thousand dollars those are going to be more done with you with a lot of accountability as well as Community as well as group coaching calls so yeah it\'s really up to you to decide you know what type of course you want to make you want to have a low ticket course where it\'s just a catalog of videos and they are left to do everything else or is it going to be a very very expensive course that comes with a bunch of things that requires your ongoing commitment as well then what I\'d actually do is create a YouTube channel making free content and sort of positioning yourself as an expert give out a lot of free value in that particular Niche and then use that audience and funnel them into your paid products that\'s really how the most successful online course creators are getting their clients I have two courses of my own the six figure YouTube Academy as well the personal brand masterclass yeah I\'ve also made a lot of content teaching people how to make online courses I\'ll actually link those down below if you do want to check them out next is starting a business that makes handmade Goods if you\'re really into do-it-yourself projects and arts and crafts then consider starting a company like this these types of products usually make really great gifts and people always need gifts for birthdays holidays and other special occasions the booming DIY Market is responsible for the enormous growth of businesses like Etsy so making and selling handmade Goods is really an awesome business idea to consider first thing you want to do of course is to figure out what you want to make once you\'ve decided on products to sell list them on websites like Etsy Amazon handmade create your own Shopify store or any other platforms that you can find online you can also Market your products on social media accounts and reach out to friends family and acquaintances to not only get the ball rolling but to also get some sales to advertise to other potential customers I do believe that if you can find create and sell a really cool and interesting product then you can turn your handmade Goods business into something really big what I would do is go on Etsy look at what some of these other Etsy sellers are selling and see if you can put your own spin onto it the more handmade customizable and like homemade the better it\'s going to perform otherwise they would just go on Amazon and buy the mass-produced version of it this is a really cool business that you guys can start from your own home you can create package and fulfill all the stuff from your home and it does really well this can absolutely grow into an Empire yeah overall a very cool way to get into e-commerce next up is creating a business that renovates and flips certain things the reality is that products including Basic Essentials are getting really expensive Frugal consumers are always looking for good deals online so one great way to make some money and build a business is to renovate and flip items online this could be like home appliances electronic devices tools mirrors bed frames couches whatever for example couch flipping has become really popular over the last year but tons of creators like Ryan banana that talk extensively about cash flipping and why it\'s such a great business to start and yeah the whole concept of this is you want to identify pieces of furniture that you know need some fixing up or refurbishing you\'ll buy that for furniture for pennies on the dollar make them pretty again and then sell them for a big profit honestly if you\'re looking for some cash flow and you have you know maybe like a truck or something like that then cash flipping or buying furniture like this is a really great way to immediately start making some money you can go on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace identify things that are really really cheap but can be fixed up buy those things fix them up and then sell them for a lot more for example maybe you could find a desk that needs to be repainted buy it for let\'s say twenty dollars apply some paints make it look a lot better cosmetically and then sell that same table for let\'s say 150 that\'s just an example but yeah you can see that you can apply this concept to a lot of pieces of furniture or pretty much anything this is a great way to get started with entrepreneurship build some cash and then take that cash and use it to start up any other business that you want to start really the perfect business for any starting entrepreneur the next business I recommend looking into is doing a real estate photography and video business so I\'ve been the real estate industry for a while now and I know the importance of visuals for selling homes for any home that\'s on the market the impact of having good images and video on that listing is tremendous I really do think that more and more people are starting to realize this that\'s why the demand for this type of service is really growing if you\'re good at photography or you get videography I definitely think this is a really great Niche to get into of course there is a pretty big learning curve right taking photos and videos of homes is much different than let\'s say doing portraits but it is a skill that you can pretty much develop within a few months and the great thing is that you know real estate agents realize just how important these things are so a lot of times they\'ll have a very big budget what I recommend doing is first get good at shooting homes create your portfolio and then start reaching out to real estate Professionals in your area you\'ll likely need to start off on the lower end of the market and then slowly and slowly you\'ll get into the more expensive homes when I first got started doing this I shot apartments for like fifty dollars but once you get into the more expensive listings I think you can generally charge between two to a thousand dollars for a good set of photos if you\'re also got a video you can bundle this with video Services now the potential to make money with this is very very big if you can become one of the best Real Estate photographers or videographers in your area I think you can easily make six figures doing this so yeah it\'s a very high value skill that you guys can do if you are passionate about photography or video it\'s super great Niche and Industry to get into because this is going to be growing for a long time next up on the list is just train crypto stocks or any other assets so I know this is not a typical type of business right it\'s much much different than the other businesses on this list but I think everyone in the world should have investing as one of their income sources the things I don\'t think investing should be a very active source of income AKA I don\'t think day trading or options trading is the best way to go about for most people the best way to invest is just to build long-term wealth by buying assets and holding them for a long time that\'s why I\'m so big on just buying index funds like vo vti and other ETFs like that because you\'ll just buy it sell it and forget it you\'re not stressing about picking particular companies you\'re not really stressed about the price movements since you\'re only caring about the future yeah with any money you have that is not being spent on yourself or your business I think putting it into Investments like this is one of the best things you can do so while not a traditional business it is an income source that I think most people should have especially if they have money that\'s just sitting on the sidelines if you guys want to get started there\'s tons and tons of platforms you guys can use to buy and sell stocks for example Weeble and MooMoo these are two my favorite platforms and yeah right now if you guys sign up you guys can actually get a ton of free stocks and I\'m going to be putting those links down below so yeah get those apps get your free stocks using my link and then just buy index funds that you hold for a long time based on history these always go up in the long term so sort of view as parking your money in an asset that is pretty much guaranteed to grow in the long term this is one of the safest ways to invest your money and like I said earlier I think this is an income stream that everyone should have especially during a recession when all assets are you know valued quite low buying Now is really a great opportunity and I guarantee you in 20 30 years you\'re going to think yourself the next business I want to talk about is running Instagram theme pages so if you\'ve used Instagram before you\'ll notice that one of the most common accounts you\'ll find on the platform are Instagram theme Pages a lot of these Pages have thousands to hundreds of thousands of followers and having all those followers makes a lot of businesses want to advertise on these pages so to create a theme page the first thing you want to do is think of some things that you are interested in Imagine a topic where you\'d be comfortable talking about it or posting about it regularly on your page also you\'ll want to consider whether the topic is marketable and reaches out to a large enough audience once you\'ve identified a niche or Focus for your page start developing a plan or upload schedule think about types of things you want to post and then start curating different content things that this takes a long time it takes a long time to build any type of audience but if you guys can grow an Instagram theme page you can actually sell this in the future or you can just sell advertising space on it I think this is a very cool way to get into content creation without having to be the face of the channel and yeah a lot of people remain completely Anonymous doing this definitely a cool business that you can start with just your phone and the income possibilities are really endless next up is creating some type of small meal prep company I think Fitness is here forever I think it\'s an industry that is still growing massively and as more and more people want to get more healthy and more and more people build their businesses and like don\'t have as much time to spend cooking for themselves I think that meal prep is something that so many people are going to start needing so yeah it\'s pretty much self-explanatory right you are going to start buying food in bulk and then meal prepping in large quantities so that you can sell to people I encourage you guys to look out for any licenses that you may need to do this but I actually know a lot of people that do this just from their homes they have a small little side hustle doing this and if you do it correctly you can actually create a pretty good healthy mrr monthly recurring Revenue the margins can be pretty big if you deliver things yourself I think that for a typical client that let\'s say orders 15 meals per week you should be able to make between 50 to 100 of profit overall I think this is a great business that you guys can start if you guys are good at cooking and it can create immediate cash flow for the clients that you bring in next business that I think you guys can start is you ugc user generated content now the rise of ugc over the last year has been astronomical and more and more companies are getting into this basically what\'s happening is a lot of companies are paying regular people that aren\'t big influencers to create content for them right this content is not posted on their own channel it\'s posted on the brand or companies Channel and so this is where you can come in if you guys are good at creating content you can actually reach out to different companies and offer to make them ugc content I don\'t recommend getting free product for this I think you guys should be getting paid and yeah the typical rates I\'ve seen range from anywhere between ten dollars to a hundred dollars per video what you want to do is build up a portfolio of content that you\'ve made and then reach out to different companies that you want to work for the thing is you\'ll want to work with companies that you actually align with and agree with because your face is going to be used for the promotional material you guys can reach out to these companies yourself or you guys can actually get started by working for an agency these agencies already have relationships with different companies that want ugc content and so they\'ll hire you pay you some amount money per post and then they\'re going to sort of be your middleman eventually though you\'ll probably want to Branch off and do this yourself because cutting out that middleman can make you a lot more money overall this is such a great way to make money from your home just by filming with your phone I think it\'s a growing content type that is going to really really take off a lot more okay so the last business we\'re talking about today is event planning and management I know event is another broad term that can Encompass things from parties to weddings to conventions and since events will always be hosted by groups of all sizes there\'s no formal education required for this area of business based on talking to my friends that do exactly this it seems like such a cool business that anyone with planning skills should start what I would do is first pick a niche that you want to focus on for example let\'s say you want to get into the wedding industry and you want to help plan weddings there\'s so many individuals that are very very talented wedding planners and what I recommend doing is look at some of their social media look at some of their websites and see how they run their business things that this is a lot more profitable than a lot of people think if you can create and curate really amazing amazing events you can easily charge thousands of dollars per event that you help organize and throw and the things that events are taking place all the time all across the world there\'s always going to be a demand for event planners and so if you\'re extremely organized you\'re good at talking to people and you\'re good at making events unique and memorable then this can be a very

INFO:root:0 output text: <s> The following is a script about 27 Lucrative Businesses to Start During The 2023 Recession. "hey guys so in today's video we are going over 27 profitable businesses that you can start during a recession this video is going to be unlike others because I'm actually going to dive a little bit deeper into how to start each of these businesses as well as the exact game plan I would take I'll also give you guys some resources that you guys check out so that you can learn more about each of these business types yeah overall every business on this list is one that I think has massive potential yeah if you're an aspiring entrepreneur this is the perfect time to get started so without further Ado let's get started the first business we're talking about today is bookkeeping this business should be able to pay anywhere from 19 to 30 per hour or more now a lot of people think that bookkeeping is extremely hard to get into but it's actually not for those of you that might not know bookkeeping is the process of recording the financial transactions of a company so what did the company buy what did the company sell Etc and what's so great about this job is that certification is actually not required however to make yourself a more marketable and attractive bookkeeper for smaller businesses a great game plan to follow is to start taking free online courses and then leveraging that knowledge in a formal online certification course you guys can start small by posting your work on freelance websites like Fiverr upwork showing that you are a talented and reliable bookkeeper the more work you do the more opportunities you'll get from bigger and bigger businesses and yeah eventually you can provide bookkeeping services for multiple clients at the same time now the pay for bookkeepers can actually vary wildly I've seen bookkeepers be paid up to a hundred dollars per hour and just really is based on the experience as well as the demand for your services I recently saw a video posted by the YouTube channel called realistic bookkeeping and she said that her pay as an amateur bookkeeper is closer to the 30 to 35 dollars per hour range but she knows that time and experience can definitely get her paid closer to sixty dollars per hour or more there are tons and tons of entrepreneurs small businesses and corporations looking for bookkeepers especially with the Boom in entrepreneurship right now and yeah I really like it because it is outsourceable at some point you can leverage with building a team but also the fact is that you can work anywhere you want which is amazing next up is becoming a content creator so as a content creator you really have no ceiling when it comes to pay look at YouTube creators like PewDiePie or Mr Beast who each have 100 million subscribers on their channels and easily make millions of dollars per month on their videos as a content creator myself a much smaller one I can tell you that it is incredibly satisfying to own a business that is based on your own creative freedom plus it can pay extremely well even if you don't have millions of subscribers I'll say that it is very hard to build an audience at first but here's some actionable steps you can take to launch your content creation career first find a marketable niche with an audience that is large enough to grow but not so large that there are already thousands of other content creators doing the same thing as you next you're gonna have to set an actual reasonable plan for creating your content how often will you post do you want to do quality or do you want equality and yeah any technical knowledge gaps can be addressed on YouTube the thing is to stay consistent and be passionate about what you're talking about now with my main YouTube channel I'm able to make over two million dollars per year just by monetizing it and yeah I think a lot of people don't realize how profitable YouTube and content creation can be what I would do if I was starting out is make a ton of videos on YouTube shorts on Tick Tock and on Instagram gram reels because all these you can basically create one video and repost it onto all different platforms after that start making long-form content create a catalog of Evergreen videos and then start focusing on more trending topics and yeah just stay at this consistently for a long long time eventually you'll be able to monetize using affiliate marketing by selling your own courses as well as YouTube AdSense and doing sponsorships the potential is actually literally Limitless with this and I really do think it's one of the best jobs in the world okay number three is being a social media manager this business should usually net you between 14 to 35 dollars per hour but of course pay can vary depending on who you work for so as a social media manager the job description is in the name you will basically be managing the social media of your clients and to successfully build a business you need to have a solid understanding of social media including the platforms the trends and the statistics start by building your own knowledge base and skill set when it comes to social media try running a theme page or a small YouTube channel as you can never run out of ideas here take courses or watch online videos breaking down how influencers build and maintain audiences on platforms like Instagram solely add accomplishments certifications and experiences to your resume and then approach small businesses who you think are suffering or can be improved in these social media departments and advertise your work and your skills as long as you can bring value when it comes to publicizing a business you'll definitely be needed somewhere and there are so many possibilities for this type of business Jordan Quinn for example is a Canadian influencer who owns an agency business called social IQ that specializes in marketing branding and web development geared especially towards assisting or managing the online platforms of parenting bloggers now whether it be parenting bloggers cooking businesses or entrepreneurs there is plenty of freedom in the work you can do as a social media manager and of course the pay is not limited to what I said earlier you can absolutely build an entire agency around this and make six seven or even eight figures per year yeah you guys know social media is blowing up even more and this is really the perfect time to get into this industry all right the next one we're talking about is a little bit different and this is a lawn mowing business now with a lawn mowing business you can usually earn 40 to 50 dollars per lawn as a reasonable starting pay however this business has quite a bit of room to grow and you can definitely build your business into a company that can net you way more over time take for instance Brian's lawn maintenance which is a lawn care business started by Brian Fullerton in 2007 that is now both a lawn care business and an online resource for other entrepreneurs they have a website a YouTube channel an Instagram profile and online course that have all amassed hundreds of thousands of followers and users the beauty of a lawn mowing business is that the startup cost is cheap and it's relatively easy to get started all you need is some Capital to buy the proper equipment which will include the lawnmower the string trimmer the leaf blower other tools and protective gear don't forget about how you will transport these tools too so you may need to track instead of using your own car or if just doing neighbors you could probably just wheel around your equipment once you have all that sorted you can start reaching out to neighbors and local residents to see if their lawns need trimming they'll schedule for your operations so you can manage several clients at the same time if you really want to get organized you can legalize your lawn care business into a legitimate operation especially when you start are hiring others to help you I personally love this business idea because it's a great idea where you can really get started at any age if you're in middle school or high school this is really a perfect business and I do consider it a pretty high value skill next up is being a freelance writer so this job can usually earn you between 50 to 200 per script with plenty of room to grow and if you really want to see how far you can go with your freelance writing business definitely look into the career and Rise of Alex fasulo who's a freelance writer who largely operates on Fiverr and as of today has made over 1.5 million dollars on the platform alone I actually interviewed here on my channel not too long ago so if you want to learn more feel free to check out that video yeah what I would do is research the freelance writing industry what our successful writers doing and once you've gauged the market you can then build your own business and skill set if you feel like you struggle with writing consider taking an online course to help improve your grammar and syntax and to also learn how to write four businesses you're catering to for example book publishers and YouTubers each incorporate very different styles of writing and so you should figure out where your strengths are in writing what I would do is I I would spend one to two months learning the whole process of writing for whatever Niche you picked for example if you want to you know get into writing YouTube scripts watch a lot of YouTube videos build out a system for writing your scripts and then build up a portfolio with that portfolio you can now reach out to YouTubers or whoever else you're targeting and offer to write them a free script if you crush it on that free script I guarantee you they're going to come back for more yeah one of the great things about freelance writing is that you can actually Outsource some of the work you can Outsource some of the research you can actually Outsource all of the writing itself yeah over time it's actually become a very big agency you'll do all the writing at first but then later you'll train people to write with the same style and with that you'll have a lot of Leverage overall a super cool business that you can start from anywhere and I really do think that the demand for these types of writers is blowing up now the next business that you guys can start is e-commerce eCommerce is the purchase and sale of goods online and any e-commerce business has virtually unlimited potential for growth and wealth Warby Parker for instance is an online retailer of eyewear that started off as a small e-commerce business and now found on the New York Stock Exchange you can think of this type of business as opening an online store so here's the game plan that I would take you first need to choose a product to sell to do this you can research the market and find a niche that strikes a balance between being relatively uncompetitive while also targeting a large enough audience make sure to research the cost of supply and also begin to see what other costs there are so that you can calculate your profits then you'll choose an e-commerce platform to sell on there's Shopify there's Amazon FBA really the list is endless with the platforms and what I would do is I'd actually either get a mentor or learn everything yourself on YouTube of course there are so many different types of e-commerce businesses so I know this can be a pretty General broad topic we have the most important thing is that your product is actually a little bit different than other people's products that you're not viewed as a commodity because this is really going to drive down your price as well as your profits instead do something a little bit different funnel things up change something that other people in reviews are saying could be worked on you sort of get my point right like make your product better or different than others from there on you'll want to build reviews you'll want to work out your Logistics and most importantly you just want to get started yes the e-commerce business can take some time and money to start growing but it's an online store this is in my opinion way better than a physical location store because you can sell to the entire world yeah super awesome business that you can do from anywhere and I personally know so many really successful e-commerce sellers you can also build a business build equity in it and sell at some point and that can net you a lot of money all right so next up is affiliate marketing and the money you can make from affiliate marketing is highly variable and largely depends on the size of your audience if you don't know affiliate marketing is a form of marketing where businesses reward you the affiliate for every visitor or customer that you bring I myself use affiliate marketing with my content by attaching affiliate links to the descriptions of my videos now get a commission for every viewer that actually clicks on that link and buys something now to get into affiliate marketing you can start on any platform whether it be Instagram YouTube Tick Tock or some other social media site I'll say the first step and the hardest step is to actually build an audience with your content there are different ways of doing this depending on your choice of platform but the the one thing that applies to anyone who wants to build an audience is to provide value and to be consistent with that value this means finding a niche that is not too competitive or a niche where you're actually highly knowledgeable yeah so for example I make a ton of content about let's say investing and within those investing videos I'll have links to you know stock platforms and when people click on those links and sign up I do actually get a small commission so yeah what you want to do is build up that audience first and then you can join affiliate marketing platforms like share sale Commission Junction or impact radius these platforms have tons and tons of companies on there who are looking for the affiliate marketers like you join those programs and then start making content that align with those products or services and I guarantee you the earning potential for this is pretty much unlimited you guys can do this on social media you guys can do blogs you guys can do newsletters there's so many creative ways you can get into affiliate marketing and of course the great thing is that it's all online based you don't need to be in a physical location yeah it's highly leveraged because you know your audience is all over the world there are billions of people yeah that's how I've been able to make over a hundred thousand dollars per month in passive income through affiliate marketing and also think that is you know somewhat the low end there are people making way more money than that so really cool business with very very high earning potential okay the next business we're talking about is just starting up any type of agency an agency is simply a company that provides specific services so they can do things like assist with web development social media marketing influencer marketing and other highly valuable skills because an agency can be such a scalable business the money that you can make from starting one can go as high as you know six seven eight even nine figures and yeah take a look at a company like omnicon group which is a New York based advertising agency that now generates billions of dollars of Revenue a year there's unlimited potential with starting an agency so yeah first things first determine your Niche your agency will have to specialize in something and realizing what you want to specialize in can help you do research into your industry your client markets and your competition choose a niche that you are knowledgeable about and that you are good at after that you're going to want to decide whether or not you want to make your agency remote doesn't actually really reduce your startup costs and enable flexibility for your business as well as your workers this also May mean that you can charge lower prices get more customers and just have lower overhead overall because of course if you're fully remote you can you know hire people from different countries that's probably a lot less expensive than hiring people just in the states or wherever you are after that you're going to want to decide on a business model for your agency to run on for example you need to decide whether your services should be paid on a flat rate on commission or on hourly rate once you have a pretty good idea of what you want your agency to be start hiring people to help you or work for you start small maybe you can actually fulfill all the work yourself at first and then after you get a client base that's when you can make your first hire now the hardest part about your agency is of course you know pulling out good work but beyond that it's going to be marketing and getting clients what I recommend doing is get on social media offer a lot of value to your target audience these are the people that would actually you know hire you in the future yeah if you can build trust with that and provide so much free value it's very likely that they will actually come to you for your paid Services you can also do direct Outreach to different companies and yeah you can get very very creative with how you get new clients overall this is a really cool business that can create a lot of cash flow for yourself okay next up is website development so this is a business that should be able to pay between 80 to 100 per hour or more websites are like virtual real estate and at this point they're always going to be in demand the great thing is that yes you can become an actual web developer but there are so many platforms now that allow you to build websites without any coding experience so I really do think that the learning curve for this is a lot smaller than it was before the first thing you're going to want to do is teach yourself how to build a website and yeah like I said it's actually not as hard as it might seem watch YouTube videos maybe get some courses and most importantly just practice a lot and build up your portfolio I recommend platforms like webflow WordPress Squarespace hostinger Wix really the list is endless after that you're going to want to reach out to people who may need websites so you can get really creative with this right you can Target entrepreneurs you can Target YouTubers you can Target twitch streamers really just choose a niche and then stick with that I really really recommend you guys don't just make General websites for everyone focus on one particular Niche get really good at that have your entire portfolio you know very specialized and I guarantee you that's going to make your conversion rates a lot higher when getting new clients there's gonna be a lot of Outreach needed but as you build up your client base and you know give them really really good results they're going to refer you to the people that they know and I guarantee your business is going to blow up like in a good way overall this is a very great high value skill that can be done just from your laptop I definitely think it's one of the perfect businesses that you guys can start during a recession or really any time okay next up is becoming a graphic designer so with graphic design you can actually make a lot of money I'd estimate anywhere between 30 to 100 per hour businesses always need graphic designers to design logos Flyers advertisements emails and any other form of marketing while it takes a bit of time to actually build your own skills and experience in this realm of business I can see this business doing extremely well once you get the hang of things your Universal game plan as a graphic design minor is to just continually build your portfolio start learning watch a ton of videos buy some courses and do think that you can build up some really great skills within one to two months if you can start to focus on a particular Niche and then start finding your first client your first clients are going to be so important because this is where you're going to learn more about the business and if you can really deliver to these clients they're going to tell their friends and you have the word of mouth for you know graphic design is very very big this can turn into a full-time agency if you have enough clients and overall it's just a very high value skill you can do from your computer and it's really a skill that a lot of people can learn just from home if I were interested in graphic design I think now would be a perfect time to get into this business okay so the next business that you guys can start is becoming a thumbnail creator for YouTubers so as a thumbnail Creator you can expect to make between five to let's say a hundred dollars per thumbnail what I recommend doing is study some of the best thumbnails that are on YouTube see what makes certain thumbnails perform really well and then start building up your own portfolio like many other businesses on this list this can be done fully remotely and the biggest challenge for this is to one get good of course but also to find clients so how I would approach this as a YouTuber who has a ton of people reaching out to me asking if they can make my thumbnails is to just you know offer free value at the start this is going to you know instantly separate yourself from everyone else that's reaching out and yeah if you can make them a really solid free thumbnail I guarantee you they're going to come back because thumbnails are extremely important if you don't want to get started that way you can actually just start going on Fiverr or upwork you'll generally probably make a bit less on those platforms but that will allow you to build up a portfolio overall I think this business has so much potential because you know more and more people are getting onto YouTube more and more people are realizing just how important these thumbnails are and so yeah if you can become one of the best thumbnail makers I really do think that this can become a six-figure business next up is starting a tick tock video editing agency so I'll need to convince you that Tick Tock is one of the biggest social media Platforms in the world we've all seen this influence on today's media and culture and yeah consequently more and more people are joining and creating content on there there's a certain style and feel to tick tock videos that can definitely be emulated which is why I think a viable business idea that you can definitely try is to start a tick tock generating agency if you watch videos on Tick Tock you'd recognize that a lot of the high performing videos are fast-paced quick cut style and yeah if you know that then you can easily make great videos for your clients the people that I would actually Target with this type of business is entrepreneurs and people that are trying to start up their personal brand there are so many people that create long-form videos on YouTube but they don't have a way to sort of cut those down and post them onto Tick Tock shorts or Instagram reels so that's basically where you're going to come in right you're basically going to identify people that are already making a lot of long-form content and then reach out to them offering to make them a few free pieces of short form videos Crusher doing that and I guarantee you they are going to come back the great thing is that you can charge note 30 to 100 per Tick Tock video you make and yeah first you can fulfill this yourself but at some point you can actually hire editors to do this for you you can easily find a video editors overseas train them to have a specific editing style for tick tock and then be able to use them to leverage your time this is a super great way to get into the content industry yeah I really think that as more and more entrepreneurs and businesses start building up their social media they'll realize hey we need people that are really good at making these Tick Tock videos and that's why the demand for this is going to pick up a lot definitely a very interesting business that I recommend starting out the next business is buying and selling domains so as we've already talked about businesses and companies will always need websites for their businesses and every website needs a domain name that is simple and memorable this is where buying and reselling domains can be a profitable business idea for you first think of some niches that you're really familiar with because then you'll have a better understanding of the values of certain domain names over others next you should check the availability of some domain names that you've thought of a great place to check is just going to be like GoDaddy or namecheap and yeah they're even going to list prices for pre-existing domain names that are already taken compare the price of your chosen domain name with other similar domains on namebio.com and buy once you feel confident in this domain name and its price afterwards choose a great platform to put your domain name in front of the buyer's market and then wait for a buyer to come in I recently read a great article about a man named Rick Schwartz a self-proclaimed domain King who's made millions of dollars registering and selling domains to massive clients including CNN of course this took him a lot of time but you can definitely see the potential here you can also sell your domain names on social media and yeah I think the Big Technical skill here is identifying which names have not yet been taken but have a lot of potential buying them for like five to ten dollars a year and then securing the right buyers another way to do this is you'll buy domains create logos for them and then make some type of website platform selling these brand identities so for example let's say the domain name thebrownchicken.com is available I'd buy that I'd make some type of logo for it and I'd package that together and sell it to people that want to start a company within that Niche I actually think this is really smart because people are way more likely to buy a domain if they see it packaged with some type of logo and yeah there are some companies out there doing this but if you can do this yourself I think that can be an amazing business idea the next business we're talking about is website remodeling slash SEO on top of domain names company websites constantly need to be remodeled and optimized for users as well as search engines this is a fundamental part of doing business online and so a lot of website remodelers SEO Consultants are constantly in demand to get started with this business you will definitely have to understand the basics of web design while also researching the ins and outs of search engine optimization or SEO there are plenty of Awesome videos online and if you wanted to go deeper take some online courses this is going to take a lot of time dedication because SEO is highly important and requires a significantly larger knowledge base than a lot of the other businesses on this list once you're comfortable with the fundamentals of optimization start assembling a portfolio of ideas that you want to provide for your clients so let's say for example you guys want to set up an SEO service right so search engine optimization for businesses well absolutely recommend doing is niching down and focusing on specific Industries the last thing you want to do is become an SEO company that you know focuses on all types of companies instead you're going to want to focus on one particular industry and focus on SEO Services only for those types of businesses you might think okay that's gonna you know make it so that I can't work with that many businesses but it's going to be the exact opposite if you're very specialized with your services then I guarantee you more and more people are going to be inclined to use you versus someone else that's more General because of course you are specialized why would they not after that offer your SEO services for friends maybe find some small businesses around you or that are online and slowly build up your Client List focus a lot of time and money on your actual delivery because that's what's going to you know make you have returning customers and that's what's going to make them actually refer you to other businesses I think SEO is a skill that a lot of people have zero clue about but it's also one that you can learn in a relatively short amount of time overall it's one of the best high value skills I think anyone can learn and if you want to create a business that's fully remote notes fully based online this is going to be one of the best ones that you can start the next business you can start is becoming a copywriter so a copywriter writes the text that is used for advertising products or Services it's a critical aspect of marketing right slogans like just do it are what make companies like Nike so Unforgettable this is why copywriters are so important to businesses and why copywriting is such a recession-proof high value skill the first important thing to note is that there are no educational requirements to becoming a really good copywriter however what I recommend doing is actually start learning online perhaps get some type of online certification for copywriting and then build up that resume if you want to build up your resume but don't have any people to write for you could definitely consider completing a copywriting internship this can definitely help you gain experience as well as network with the right people in a similar space as you but yeah if you want to skip that I recommend just get good at copywriting offer the service to your friends into small businesses and offer to write them some free or discounted copy start small and your copywriting as it helps more and more businesses will will justify your value you can also get started on Fiverr and upwork but those are generally going to pay you a bit less and I think that for most people the best way to get started is like I said reach out to businesses and people fulfill these Services yourself on your own and at some point start hiring people to do the writing for you it's absolutely a skill that you can train other people to have and that's why this can turn into a massive scalable business that resembles an agency copywriting is another really really great high value skill that I think everyone should have and that's why it has the potential to make a lot of money and turn into a full-on agency the next business we're talking about is getting into sales and I know this is a very broad category but that's because there are so many possibilities here obviously companies will always need people to sell their products and services if you feel like sales is the business you want to take on then these companies will always need people like you now the type of business that I personally would start in sales is create some type of agency where you find Setters teach them how to sell High ticket products and then put those Setters within other businesses the reason why this is so cool is because you you can actually you know train people to become good sales people and then these companies who are looking for people to sell their High ticket products will often pay between let's say five to ten thousand dollars per person and yeah this is just a placement fee you guys they'll literally pay your company five to ten thousand dollars to make the intro to someone that you have trained and put that person within their company you guys can probably see why this is so scalable it's because you can basically create some type of system teaching people how to become great sales people enroll them in that course that you've created and if it works then you'll have a ton of great sales people that other businesses are really going to want to have within their company do this and then reach out to businesses that sell High tickets programs and then offer to place your Setters within their company this is a super high margin business that can be done from anywhere I really think it's in an industry a niche that is blowing up okay number 17 is becoming a virtual assistant there's so many companies and entrepreneurs out there that need a lot of things done including scheduling appointments arranging travel making phone calls or organizing inbox these tasks can eat up a lot of productive time so what these people will often do is hire virtual assistants to do these tasks for them now this is probably one of the lower paying jobs on this list but it can be done from anywhere you can build up a lot of valuable skills yeah it's really not one of those jobs that you'll probably do forever but it's such a great way to get into the online space and start making money from home just from your laptop you'll probably want to have some skills like being good at Microsoft Office Excel whatever it is but for most people they're going to learn a lot of these skills while on the job the great thing is that you don't need to have a degree you just need to be hard working and you need to be able to actually you know take on a lot of tasks and be able to sort of multitask if you're good at this then I think you can become an awesome virtual assistant and yeah if you're in the States you can probably charge between 15 to 30 an hour and eventually you may even be able to create some type of virtual assistant company or platform where you set up virtual assistants with other entrepreneurs you guys can get really creative with this industry but I really do think that there are so many people that are going to be looking to hire virtual assistance within the next five to ten years and you can either be the virtual assistant yourself or you can be the one to actually find virtual assistants train them and then place them within other companies number 18 is just going to be freelancing on a platform like Fiverr or upwork you guys have already heard me talk about these platforms but I think during a recession especially right now becoming a freelancer is such a good way to make money online it's a business that doesn't really cost any money to start since it is service based you know that's why I think anyone watching this video can pretty much immediately start by identifying a skill they have listing that skill on a platform like Fiverr upwork and then start freelancing some type of specific service what I'll do is take a look at Fiverr and upwork marketplaces and see what types of services people are offering this can help you brainstorm and identify what types of skills you have that you can actually you know sell or offer as a service and yeah if you look online there are some people doing really creative things such as singing happy birthday for clients along with pretty much anything you can think of then you'll want to create your own Fiverr or upwork accounts now there are plenty of online tutorials and articles that can help you actually optimize your accounts and your listings list your services online provide quality work and then the reviews will speak for themselves yes this is going to take some time to build up but once you've developed enough traction and reputation freelance work on these sites can actually become a very very big source of your income if you guys can get selected for Fiverr Pro that's immediately going to make your business take off do everything you can to satisfy your customers and clients get those five star reviews at some point you will be able to get selected for Fiverr Pro overall I just want to sort of separate and create this independent category for Fiverr or upwork because I think freelancing is such a great business that anyone can start and if you want to get into entrepreneurship this is one of the best ways to do that online next up is selling an online course so people are always hungry for knowledge and education especially when it comes to learning new skill sets or subjects and yeah as you guys probably know there are many things that are not taught in schools one of the most lucrative business ideas that you guys can start today is actually developing marketing and selling an online course for a desirable skill that teaches people how to make money money the first thing you're going to do of course is to identify a skill that you can teach what I recommend doing is find a way to you know connect that skill to making money the best courses that are the most profitable teach people how to make money in any certain way develop some type of system create some type of video course packaging everything you know into let's say a 10 to 20 hour course and then use a platform like kajabi teachable thinkific whatever to host that course there are so many resources that you guys can check out to you know actually learn what makes a course good and what makes a course profitable and so yeah if this resonates with you I definitely recommend doing more research but overall the whole industry of online courses is growing I think education is slowly shifting from you know more general education to very specific skills and online courses are the best way for that shift to happen the great thing is that the margins are extremely high but of course it does take a lot of time to initially create that course the game plan that I would personally do is first figure out if there's demand for the idea you have you can pre-sell your course and if there's good interest then you can actually you know start making your course I'd say that typically a course will take you between two to four weeks to create if you're doing this full time and so yeah you'll want to make sure that the demand is there before you actually invest that much time into it you can either go low ticket and create cheaper courses between 10 to let's say 100 each or it can go more High ticket and sell courses that are between let's say three to ten thousand dollars those are going to be more done with you with a lot of accountability as well as Community as well as group coaching calls so yeah it's really up to you to decide you know what type of course you want to make you want to have a low ticket course where it's just a catalog of videos and they are left to do everything else or is it going to be a very very expensive course that comes with a bunch of things that requires your ongoing commitment as well then what I'd actually do is create a YouTube channel making free content and sort of positioning yourself as an expert give out a lot of free value in that particular Niche and then use that audience and funnel them into your paid products that's really how the most successful online course creators are getting their clients I have two courses of my own the six figure YouTube Academy as well the personal brand masterclass yeah I've also made a lot of content teaching people how to make online courses I'll actually link those down below if you do want to check them out next is starting a business that makes handmade Goods if you're really into do-it-yourself projects and arts and crafts then consider starting a company like this these types of products usually make really great gifts and people always need gifts for birthdays holidays and other special occasions the booming DIY Market is responsible for the enormous growth of businesses like Etsy so making and selling handmade Goods is really an awesome business idea to consider first thing you want to do of course is to figure out what you want to make once you've decided on products to sell list them on websites like Etsy Amazon handmade create your own Shopify store or any other platforms that you can find online you can also Market your products on social media accounts and reach out to friends family and acquaintances to not only get the ball rolling but to also get some sales to advertise to other potential customers I do believe that if you can find create and sell a really cool and interesting product then you can turn your handmade Goods business into something really big what I would do is go on Etsy look at what some of these other Etsy sellers are selling and see if you can put your own spin on

INFO:root:input text: ['The braiding/weaving in custom that @Caffeine Delusions came up with, came from Novayan spacers and was part of traditions that are a way identity and history get passed on in an individualistic culture, and it became something many spacer humans connected to because of condition of often not having families or even other members of their cultures in their new situation I’ve thought the cats might do ritual body mods that are basically a tattoo that’s both cut and inked. I wonder if the mark Sparks has on her face comes from a Novayan custom originally. I have to think about what it means. It communicates information to anyone seeing it. If it’s a Novayan symbol it buys some social capital with novayans. Given every Novayan mark has contextual meaning. Nadiran find humans brash and impulsive but a bit better than Novayans who are even more brash and impulsive and also smelly and even more violent. Anyone who doesn’t live as long as they do is potentially a dangerous savage child race. Stereotypes of Novayans: passionate, impulsive romantics; a bit "Puss in Boots" in space. They\'re also individualistic, and the most individualist culture. There are elements of human spacer culture on the Perimeter that come from the Novayan influence, because Novayans were working those lanes for various employers before humans even showed up. I really feel @Caffeine Delusions\'s "weaving in"/"woven in life" ideas evolved from what may have been an existing element of Novayan culture. Especially in an oral trad culture, which Novayans are. (No problem with not showing their writing system.) I\'m doing a brief write up of the origin of @Caffeine Delusions\' weave/braid custom and placing it as a syncretic custom that evolved in relationship between humans and novayans... This is making some assumptions about culture transmission that are very, very inconvenient to modern discourse. The Orphans of Earth were human immigrants to alien space. Novayans were the existing workers of the space lanes. They worked side by side for about 3 generations, at least - there are customs that have evolved from that interaction that aren\'t purely human, aren\'t purely Novayan, and that doesn\'t matter to anyone. I\'m nailing it as originally a Novayan custom. Called r\'khatha. Novayans have informal brotherhood customs, and there\'s some weird gendering in that they\'re a very gendered culture with some sex-essentialist species traits, but anyone who gets considered brother to a Novayan, is going to be called that regardless of their own gender identity. Novayans only have one term for this. Novayans have worked the space lanes for generations, even previous to humans getting there, so there\'s a probability that some other culture group they worked with did genetic scanning and probably was taking gene samples of them. It evolved further as more and more Novayans braided humans, and humans braided other humans. Novayan brotherhood groups are not based on shared bloodlines, which made them scalable to other species too. (edited) Novayan males\' #1 cause of death is other Novayan males. A bit. Also, it gives you a chance to show off a Novayan with a spectacular hairstyle in the character\'s backstory and art. Maybe she\'s still in contact with some of his Found Family brothers because they grieved together. All Novayan males have manes (females too, but much shorter) and I\'ve just now decided that they put braids and baubles in their hair. This gives me a chance to develop the Novayans more, too. I know that the way I want to portray it is that humans hook up with bipedal cats all the damned time and nobody ever remarks on it. Everyone always wants to party with the Novayan. Novayans seem like a lot of them are horndogs who are interacting with other species because they want to fuck. Like, very apres ski/shore leave atmosphere. Or even heading to sex tourism levels in some cases I think Novayans have a reputation for being party animals. Novayans are a culture that Perimeter Humans have had a lot of interaction with, especially working for the Co-Op. Like... I don\'t even think a human/Novayan relationship, especially between space workers, is necessarily that remarkable in setting. Something I"m enjoying contrasting is some of the human characters\' sense of grim get-on-with-it mentality with the Novayans, who I think are very expressive, and very open about their emotions This has fascinating implications because there\'s an implication that if males have to be deballed to live among females full time, the equivalent may be true of females living among males. Though I\'ve implied female Novayan spacers often take a suppressant med. Im sure there are Novayans who object to Novayans doing any high tech interventions on their mating cycle, as well as Novayans who are probably speciesist and culturally purist. And it probably goes together. Likely... but there are also probably Novayans who can only really get an actual quality of life because of technological interventions and diverse communities, so the middle is probably somewhere between the two. Also, random thought, maybe I\'m actually starting to wake up, but... Novayan Kittens. It\'s interesting that despite sex essentialist culture, these don\'t map to gender identity for Novayans. It\'s just a cold blooded necessity due to their biology unless they actually want to revert to being feral hunters full time. It may be connected to "this is the difference between us and ANIMALS." I\'m going more generalized, though there are some phenotypes of Novayan (which I suppose maps a bit to human "races" except that Novayans may not ascribe the same meaning to it at all) that have a particular look, such as the silver-furred blue-eyed Northerners with their luxuriant fur, and the tawny short-furred Southerners. Novayans: the Catfolk of the Perimeter (notes and sundry) Novayans: the Catfolk of the Perimeter (notes and sundry) The Novayans have been in space longer than humans have. They do not know where they originally come from - only that they have traveled far, traveled wide, seen much, and vow to return to their childhood home to bring their stories back home to their family’s oral history, which they refer to, poetically, as Weaving: joining their personal story of their adventures gained far afield, to their home. Novayans have special customs related to wandering and coming home, as well as customs related to the track ways and roads they travel - but especially, for those that go Wandering in space, for space itself, where they are in the hands of their ancestral Guides and live by the wisdom imparted in their songs. . Some of their folk songs reference “the Ways Across the Void,” thought to be a poetic device to refer to their earliest history during a time of legends, before they settled the world on which they live. These songs refer to trackways and roads - described as tunnels in space - that their ancestors used to navigate to their homeworld. To be the Novayan that can prove the existence of such a thing, to live in the stars as Guide in one’s death to the generations of travelers after them, is something any Wanderer would love to claim. \\*\\* Plenty of humans loved Novayans, but more enjoyed them casually. They had a reputation: sooner or later, the urge to wander would take over, and the Novayan would be off on his next flight. A Novayan male’s life was his and his alone, if even on his own world, that life risked being nasty, brutish, and short. From the first day that their quick, light feet took them to the new spaceport the Nadiran spacing authority had put on their world, they’d set another path to wander, seeking their Guides among the stars themselves. And when the Nadiran left, and the Men (as the Nadiran called them) came – the terms were amenable, and more Novayans wandered offworld than ever before. Usually they came back – even if they were no match for some of the older, tougher Wanderers living outside the villages, females actually preferred a guy with a throat full of songs and a chest, back, and face full of the cut and inked glyphs of storied deeds. Stories of epic failure, even imprisonment, were preferable to having done nothing at all. What was the point of being a Wanderer at all, if not to have a song to sing about it? May as well stay home and give up your balls! But sometimes Wanderers stayed away. If they had a mate offworld – they might never return. They had no control over this whatsoever. One could not help who one loved, and a Novayan who could help that, probably was… broken, or something. But there was this. Within an actual pair, a male could potentially live longer, could have a much better life, especially if their partner were intelligent and nimble and strong. Be that partner male or female, that did not matter offworld, though if female – and given good hunting territory – they might form a clan of their own. There were more males offworld, so there were plenty of Novayan male companions who worked the lanes together. But a non-Novayan, now? That was not unheard of, either. From the time the first Novayans left their world, they had taken up with aliens. Their reserved, imperious Nadiran employers had no interest in them, and the feeling was very much mutual. The statuesque Altikhari warrior women who worked the lanes with them, sometimes took them to bed for a night, but it wasn’t much more than that, and… the preferences of Altikhari could be… unique even by cat standards, and we will just leave it at that. But then humans arrived. And inevitably, sometimes Novayans took up with them. Humans proved to be even more fickle than Novayans had the reputation for being. But not always. It would not matter if they had been. Because Novayans loved who they loved, and they had no say over this, just as they had no say in the matters of their ancestral Guides who shined down on them from above and guided the Wanderers in their Wandering. To be disappointed in love was as worthy of poetry and song as to win at it. Only a broken Novayan never dared. Only the most pitiful Novayan should ever return home with no tale to tell, having gotten his ears and tail into no trouble at all! \\*\\* Novayans don\'t have anything resembling a theocrat or a theocat, I think they are totally into woowoo and lore and myth and probably have their witches and shaman figures. It\'s probably another thing about them that seems vaguely Norse. Novayans actually in a bonded pair (not super super common, but frequent enough) have some resistance to frenzying at the scent of those pheromones though. Novayans have oral tradition about sailing ships in the sky and an animistic, individualistic belief system with soothsayers and elders and dream-ships traveling the Milky Way - called the Starry Path. I think that originally what happened is they became part of the interstellar community because someone spacefaring made first contact, possibly either a crash or someone traveling in a small group from far away, and the Novayans may have actually had the upper hand in the situation and began trading Bonding probably has a biochemical element in terms of discouraging Frenzy somewhat. At least due to the scent of females. A general calming of the temperament. I want to point out that my character\'s having a Novayan for a spouse, isn\'t unheard of. It\'s not super common, but not unheard of. Their reputation among offworlders is for sleeping around if they\'re not actually with anyone though. (edited) (I\'m thinking Novayans have two separate sets of customs for your mates vs what you do during estrus. Estrus mating is mindless and sometimes people die. I wonder if females offworld sometimes use sperm donors.) I also think the females select against the worst, most frenzied Novayans and often choose the gentler ones with the shorter dickspines. It\'s just that in the wild, there\'s less choice. Maybe even that training is the rule for lots of males and only the ones who become champions, stay uncut anyway. I think Novayans see themselves as a civilized people with a beast core, not as beasts who happen to live in villages. They may loathe feraldom and the Frenzy in fact and many Novayans may be like, "if that ever happens to me, kill me." given the degree to which I\'m painting Novayans as having kind of a romantic image to them, I should lean into the Beast as a little bit of design inspiration. “You like that I hit my brother for you for making the sex in your hab every night? If you like, R’Kesh hits him like the punching bag. One thousand times for K’Ratha.” “Yes,” Sparks said, between bites of her food. “Go ahead. Beat the ever living shit out of him. I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep since my roommates started passing him like a doob. Fuckin’ tomcat.” “The tomcat who is going to get himself killed extra-dead one day,” R’Kesh replied. Suddenly he had grown thoughtful and solemn. He looked down at the remaining ration of salmon cubes on his plate. “Novayan male life span, not that great. Tell me he is wrapping it up, ay?” Okay so the thing elsewhere about Novayans doing everything out in the open, and a recent attempt at my own bathroom privacy had me wondering - are they basically going to go up to random humans and hang out while the poor besieged one is just trying to take a crap in peace? I just imagine one going all wide-eyed and a little too close to the human\'s face and asking if they\'re taking a shit with this big absurd grin. Omg yes, need to have this scene. They\'ll just follow you and continue their conversation. The specific Novayan im focusing on seems somewhat worldly, but his brother (perhaps younger and not a littermate?) Would absolutely do that (edited) ...sanitation specialist among Novayans would be privy (ahem) to so much of the social scoop But... I actually like R\'Kesh and he was a good dude. The kind of person who\'d put himself in between his brother and some big frenzied Novayan thug and die for it. I\'m figuring that she was brought into R\'Kesh\'s specific lodge, and that this isn\'t unheard of for non-Novayans, and there are lodges that are even mostly non-Novayan. (It\'s interesting to consider given what I\'ve characterized of the social order of a bit of the Inmost, and also because I\'m establishing that Novayans\' origins are within the Inmost.) Not necessarily. For purposes of Novayan culture, whether it\'s even recognizably "couply" is totally up to the bond, it\'s not even necessarily romantic, you can be in that kind of a pair bond with your sibling and they don\'t give a shit. They have very strict compartmentalization in their culture between procreative sex in season and whatever you do with your buddies and bondmates. Also another thing coming off with Novayans is that they have a warrior path, but it\'s not about becoming a better fighter or killer, they\'re already killers. R’Kesh went offworld after his mating, deciding that being a Clan Champion just wasn\'t worth it. He really wanted to study lore and travel, and he went Wanderer. Also, working in micro-g actually lowers Novayan testosterone levels just enough, they calm down a bit, aren\'t as subject to the wild swings they\'d be subject to on Novaya, and over time the dick spines become nubs. Though they don\'t calm down as much as cut-ears calm down. (edited) Example of Novayan affection being different... instead of leaning in for a kiss, when he first wanted to express that... he brought her hand up to his face and rubbed his cheek on it. Novayans are perceiving Val taking R’Kesh’s life quest as some really foolhardy human daring the gods, or willing to die over what was actually not - to any Novayan other than K\'Ratha personally, who was personally hurt - really that big of an offense. Novayans are actually more adapted to micro-g environments than humans are, in some ways. In the case of intact males, it\'s actually beneficial, as their hormones level out in space, and with the loss of smell, they lose some sensitivity to the female pheromones. They tend toward being ambidextrous, and their tails latch to a handhold, so they have both hands free. ...their attention also can shift at a moment\'s notice failing something being actually life or death. (Everything is life or death in space and it suits them.) You\'re standing there talking to your Novayan syndic friend when you\'re at port and you turn around, and he\'s gone, and it\'s because something caught his notice. This is worse with Novayans who are idle, and they\'re usually off looking for fun the moment they step off the ship, depending. (They vary in temperament as much as humans, and R\'Kesh felt ready to settle down.) Their ears, tails, and noses lead them to surprising places sometimes. They\'re sharp on the job though. (edited) The other thing is that built spaces arranged specifically around Novayans, such as some clanships, aren\'t that comfortable - with usability consequences - to humans. But some stuff is also stuff like... not caring about privacy in some cases. Novayans don\'t feel that restrooms need a door nor that you shouldn\'t continue on a conversation with someone who\'s pooping. (edited) Though Novayans can operate at far lower levels of light than either Nadiran or human. An example of characterization of a Novayan. This is R’Kesh, as told by his wife Val: R\'Kesh and I walked along the path through the Arboretum that connected the main atrium to the soundproofed Nadiran Quarter of Perimeter Two. The quiet suited a Novayan’s even sharper ears. The atrium’s echo had given way to the growing quiet of the Arboretum path, and further down the curving path, I heard the faint bell of a Krayahan shrine keeping the time, and looked up at R’Kesh to see that his ears and whiskers had perked; he’d heard it too. He stopped and tensed momentarily, his attention drawn away, and from my time around Novayans, I knew that any moment, he would be halfway down the path ahead of me, regardless of what we had been talking about in the moment, and he probably would not even remember what that had been. I kept my eyes straight ahead, anticipating his bounding off. As much as I’ve traveled with Novayans and found a kinship with them, it’s one of the things that reminds me we’re not the same. And that didn’t happen. R’Kesh looked up at the source of the sound, then looked back at me, still attentive. His eyelids narrowed briefly, and he averted his gaze again, which I understood to be Novayan politeness. \\*\\* I think Novayan balls should be fuzzy and round like cat balls. Novayan tails can latch onto a handhold in microgravity,leaving their hands free. I wrote this and then I realized, if this is what Novayan kits are like, do they even fit in anything resembling a classroom? The norm would be to just be raised on their homeworld, where they are usually in a family/village environment and getting tons and tons of outdoor physical activity young (physical stuff and hunting and singing are probably big focuses of the earliest education before they start loading the three Rs into their heads; that may actually come later in a young Novayan\'s education) what do we do with the kids offworld? Especially given Novayans bear litters? (edited) Val Renberg speaks about Novayans: “And there I was - with Novayans, who the instructor always had to go find and bring back into the class – perked as their ears and whiskers were for the slightest anything. And I do mean anything. The kits lashed their tails, and got up and paced from time to time. Young Novayans are either sleeping, or moving. They would do their part of the project and predictably, any Novayan would then be off again, wandering the halls or climbing in one of the rec rooms. Novayan kits could be annoying as hell, and it took a while before I found any Novayans at all any joy to share a classroom with. I usually took my project off into one of the spare resource rooms and worked on it by myself, and came back with my contribution. The important thing is that the class made room for all of us.” It may be that the age at which a Novayan is in Primary (basically going to be the equivalent of earliest grades) is actually older relative to a human and that their education is front loaded with the physical, emotional, social education per Novayan developmental standards, not human, and that raising a Novayan by human norms would actually damage them and create a Novayan who\'s not fit for Novayan society. (edited) Yeah, i was thinking that Novayans probably start school a bit later, but might learn faster But this makes sense for Novayans, they may physically develop pretty quickly and I think the culture may put more focus on combat skills (for discipline) early. It\'s important to learn to hold back - and to learn etiquette - because any Novayan, just by nature, is capable of just going into a single minded bloodlust and slaughtering people (and probably die doing it) just because of what they are. Because they bear litters of extremely inquisitive, ACTIVE children, who start learning to hunt young and who play really rough, a Novayan village will likely consist of a couple of actively breeding mothers, and a larger number of cut ear adults. Little Novayans just can... unleash unholy hell. Novayans are notorious for chugging gallons of coffee and stimulant drinks in space btw. Whatever their ears and whiskers pick up... they are on it, before even humans have detected the thing. They\'re already down the hall checking it out. It\'s not something Novayans are at all raised to discourage. It\'s a success mode. Having a fun time with the superstitious/spiritual nature of the Novayans. Feeling that R\'Kesh went Wanderer because a Seer told him to, and felt that out there, with his life guided by the Stars Themselves, he would do something important that she foresaw. He met Val on the life quest that he took, and Val took on that quest for him. But I think there is a thing of, "you are who I was supposed to meet out here, in the black." He would not have known that Val would be taking on his life quest after his death, and completing it for him (and everyone who\'d carried that same uncompleted quest over the centuries). But the Seer may have foreseen something. (edited) A Novayan\'s ears and whiskers twitch at something the humans around them don\'t hear or feel - and they\'re off. They\'re checking out Whatever-It-Is. They\'re already on it. It\'s also interesting to me to develop a culture for whom - well - their base survival needs are already somewhat baked in. A single Novayan left to themselves on some planet, could just go feral, as long as there\'s animal life there. So they built their culture around being more than that. Around their loves, their stories, their personal quests, their arts and knowledge ways, and attaining a personal best. Only possible with mastery of the Beast. (edited) Novayans have six nipples, tall pointed ears, long whiskers on their muzzle and eyebrows. Males have a retractile penis and that of intact males is covered in spines, though these may blunt and shorten over the time spent in space. R\'Kesh and his brother K\'Ratha at the point of writing belong to a lodge or brotherhood of other Wanderers; there are a couple of other human spacers in it, Val is brought in too, and lodges among Novayans can have the weight of syndicates. (Well, with the exception of big mega-syndicates like ItSyn.) Your other memberships will matter possibly in terms of politics/loyalties but being in a lodge is one of the options. Novayan tattoos - marks they have, cut (so fur doesn\'t grow back over the mark) and stained into the skin, indicate relationships to other Novayans (and Wanderers) over space and time, so: Say you have a Novayan who is out on a light run. (A chunk of them are Light Chasers. It\'s nothing to them. It isn\'t disruptive to their lives the way it is to a humans, because Novayan Wanderers often just leave the homeworld and never return.) They come back and a few generations have been born and raised since they were gone. Or - they\'re not Light Chasers, they\'ve just been gone a damned long time. I like the image of "Light Chaser" in relation to a Novayan though because it sounds like they\'re chasing the red dot doesn\'t it. The Novayan returning, will be sung back into the lodge - it may be by descendants of those who sung him away. What knowledge (or whatever else) he brings with him will be brought into the lodge; if you make a promise as a Novayan you may be fulfilling it on the descendants of whomever you promised it to, or onto your lodge-kin down the road. It has implications for Val\'s taking R\'Kesh\'s Life Quest, because she fulfills that then brings the knowledge he sought back to his lodge. Some years have passed, but it was a long term Life Quest that had probably been passed among various Novayans. Once one has been fulfilled, it\'s retired and not passed along anymore. The role of the Seer is pointed out here too because when R\'Kesh went Wanderer, he would\'ve had a Seer read him before going. (edited) Wanderer affiliation is diffuse and possibly decentralized (there are some Co-Op Spacer culture elements that filtered down from Novayan Wanderers), and Novayans outside of their own families may be wired to socialize individual-to-individual. Like, you can simply take up another individual\'s Life Quest, full stop. Val is not the first human to live among Novayans nor be accepted by some of them. And it doesn\'t make someone automatically a Novayan, though if they have tattoos (as she does) indicating having gone through some Novayan-specific cultural rituals in the proper way, it might establish more trust... about specific things... but the thing is, Novayan culture outside of their villages/clans, is individualist Novayans aren\'t being rescued by anyone; there is no Human Savior; Novayans didn\'t need saving, are fully agentic, have zero oppression history with humans (Nadiran might be another matter, to some degree, but nothing on the scale of chattel slavery or genocide), were a well established and semi successful population when humans showed up, and Novayans are possibly even more agentic than humans will ever be. If anything they deserve credit for saving our asses multiple times. (edited) Novayans spend long periods of time brushing/cleaning/grooming themselves, and each other. Tend to get lost in thought doing it. Novayan currency is hugely reputation. Novayans purr. Novayans probably don\'t use blankets. Be funny though if they like tightly packed nests. Just because I want an excuse for R\'Kesh\'s brother to be found sleeping off a hangover in a box. I love the idea of the Novayan comfy room. They laze around in it, nest, curl up, groom each other, lie around like sybarites and drink and eat snacks. Ok, what if the nest is actually the central part of any Novayan community. Will be the central part of an all-Novayan ship, a village, a household, all kinds of other spaces. There is probably some etiquette about intruding on Novayans\' nesting spaces. Being invited into one is basically... bonded pair, or family member Novayans lead so much with their feelings - their impulses - and being able to pair with someone who can be a grounding influence, two buddies or brothers or mates having each other\'s back, is the best for both of them. I haven\'t thought about the issue of someone who\'s used to eating the same predictable types of food day in and day out living on a ship, adjusting to different foods, but that\'s an issue anyway. Even traveling with Novayans wouldn\'t have been that weird, they eat food cubes and dried stuff too, they just tend more toward the keto side of it. But stuff is likely to get truly strange on Kybaria. The human Val’s chin tattoo is a mark of kinship between her, K\'Ratha, and R\'Kesh. The one down the right side of her face is from undertaking a life quest; if her body had been found then it would\'ve been obvious to any Novayans that she had died carrying a Novayan\'s quest out, given enough context cues to show it\'s not fake. She has tattoos indicating how many generations of Co-Op spacer she is, some that basically echo some of her rating patches, some showing number of light runs, and a braided tribal looking wristband that echoes the Weave bracelet (basically indicating she was married.) Whatever else idk. The Co-Op CO symbol too because that becomes a plot point. Possibly some of the physical discipline stuff she might\'ve learned from being married to a Novayan tom? The place this connects much later on, is that years after the humiliating situation at Rowantree, when she has the chance to take the credit jumping the wormhole, she lets the Novayans have that, that she did it specifically as Wanderer carrying out a dead Wanderer\'s work, and that this is shared with Captain Karrath (of the Novayan ship that brought her up to the wormhole, then met her on the other side 18 months later) and Karrath\'s family/crew. (edited) So basically if you\'re being chased by a pack of Novayans, huck a sack of battery powered mouse toys and strobe lights off to the side and saunter in the opposite direction. \\* Novayans, my cat race. (They\'re going to come into game. I actually did a bit of worldbuilding and lore for them, I\'ll just say in the Trek game that they\'re a Caitian cousin, since we know nothing about Caitians. Meanwhile here\'s a semi fleshed out cat race.) so regarding that whole ass cat species... canonical to previous builds of the setting, before I replaced the Neoterrans with the Co-Op, the Novayans were already there, and the thing is, they are inherently individualistic. Like, it\'s baked in. Well, the males are anyway. D — 11/29/2021 10:07 AM I feel a ton of Novayans would\'ve ended up spacers hugely because... well... they individually go out and seek more wandering range, it\'s a species thing. It\'s what they already do. They\'re probably not governable by traditional human systems of governance. Their own world just has enough room to roam. D — 11/29/2021 10:10 AM I kept Novayans this whole time mostly because in game, every group had one person who wanted to be a cat dude. D — 11/29/2021 10:18 AM But one thing that strikes me is that if Novayans were among the most heavily represented aliens on the Perimeter at the time that the Co-op began forming, they are probably among the aliens most represented in Co-op spacing. D — 11/29/2021 10:25 AM Funny fact in the original setting, "Novayan" comes from the original name of the human colony that was there in the original build of the setting, Novaya Moskva, which ultimately failed, but the planet remained titled "Novaya" and people totally forgot the original name. D — 11/29/2021 11:37 AM But that said, the rarity of encountering a Novayan female offworld makes it easier to deal with too. The Co-Op D — 11/29/2021 10:02 PM btw, the Novayans have a significant part in Co-op spacing. World Bible 1.0 D — 11/30/2021 4:25 PM People\'s religious beliefs will be what they are, and cultures\' religious beliefs, and telepathy even exists, as well as some species things that seem woo woo (like the Myrmidons, Nadiran, Novayans), and possibly trippy consciousness shit, and plenty of stuff that\'s "indistinguishable from magic," and people may even draw strength from their beliefs in ways that matter. But there are no godlike aliens influencing anything. Godlike aliens/Space Jesus/Ancient Astronauts are a hard line I\'m going to draw. (edited) aliens D — 11/30/2021 9:09 PM indeed, it would be. I\'m not even sure they like the company of Novayans, who are furry and... often... probably smelly. D — 11/30/2021 9:10 PM It was amusing to realize that Novayans were probably the first alien culture whose members really took to Co-Op spacing. D — 11/30/2021 10:14 PM (Human and Novayan) future-slang D — 12/02/2021 9:03 PM May have come into the vernacular to humans via Novayan and Altikhari spacers, who had contact with unaligned/black market Nadiran clients in past years. D — 12/02/2021 9:46 PM I\'ll put the other stuff in the aliens channel, but here are the slurs: Myrmidons: bugs Nadiran: Naddies, Nads, Graymen, Vampires, Space Elves (Spelves?) Novayans: cats (questionably a slur? They seem to have a good sense of humor about it at least.) aliens D — 12/02/2021 9:56 PM Novayans: indigenous to a world of the Perimeter, Novayans were spacing (individually, usually with the black market until the Co-Op formed) along the Perimeter for a long time so there are probably a lot of Novayan culture quirks and terms that have migrated into spacer slang as well. They don\'t take themselves overly seriously and have a good sense of humor about being called "cats." Their individualism and tradition of solitary wandering to gain reputation and skill both suit them well to spacer life, and they\'ve been at it in the region for generations longer than humans. They make good hired muscle but you just as often see them as navigators and/or pilots. Many readily embraced the rise of the Co-Op as giving them less shady people to work for. Tend to be trustworthy as they\'re not culturally that inclined toward caring about getting rich, the currency is in the stories they collect and challenges they successfully meet before returning home. I get to decide who else is here, we have the Altikhari, who are dominantly a Nadiran client state but who have individuals that work the lanes, but tend to be more aligned with the Nadiran. I\'m sure there are lots of other aliens, those are just the cultures that are the most developed at this point. I actually removed Tectrans from the setting because Earth kind of takes their place now. Also, they have a dumb name. I guess I thought it was cool at 15. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 12/03/2021 12:31 AM Other maybe less than flattering nicknames for Novayans: pussies, pelts, merkins Jump D — 12/03/2021 9:50 AM Ooh yes. I am amazed btw, this may be Novayans’ big break in the universe. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/03/2021 3:40 PM Drinks/parties with Novayans, grew up around some. (edited) aliens D — 12/03/2021 4:10 PM \\* Humans even love their children and will absolutely kill or die - but first kill - for them. This is surprising to Myrmidons (who have a single child watching caste) and Novayan males, who have little to nothing to do with their offspring. D — 12/03/2021 4:15 PM \\* In some cases - relative to some non-humans in setting - humans even have culture and subculture. Myrmidon culture is based on eusocial biology, Novayans are very highly individualistic (to the extent that they may not identify in terms of "culture" so much as individual experiences), Nadiran are hidebound traditionalists with extreme rules of etiquette, etc. But humans exist across a huge spectrum of behavior. (edited) Caffeine Delusions — 12/03/2021 5:27 PM Novayan kitten? Adopted. Discarded Nadiran girl? Adopted. D — 12/03/2021 5:55 PM The biggest thing that happened for the Nadiran after the Black & Gray/Red & White schism, and the Red & White allying up with the humans and Novayans on the other side of the Perimeter with their legally elected Prefect being protected by the humans - character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/04/2021 9:01 AM But Novayan spacers had been working the lanes longer than humans, through various changes of employers, and had legends and verse, including some that had come via previous Nadiran employers (at a time when the Nadiran trade empire was even bigger). aliens D — 12/05/2021 1:16 PM I\'ve been working on it; we\'ve got the Novayans playing a much bigger part, plus the Myrmidons (new species), plus a bunch of others that I just haven\'t mapped out yet. I decided space was crowded. Caffeine Delusions — 12/05/2021 1:17 PM Like... the Myrmidon are nice, but the thing about hive-mind style societies is that because their members aren\'t individuated, there isn\'t the same impetus for them to socially MIX, which means that from an individual level, the only species a PC could have a meaningful conversation with are Human, Novayan, and Nadiran. spacers-space-setting D — 12/06/2021 1:49 PM even as individualist as Novayans are, there are still basic predictable patterns rooted in biology - tons of their cultural mores revolve around estrus (edited) welcome D — 12/07/2021 9:39 AM ...I wonder if it\'s a Novayan tradition that got adopted by humans offworld Caffeine Delusions — 12/07/2021 9:40 AM I think with Novayans it\'s probably \'and I got this from someone important that I want to remember even though I\'ll probably never see them again\'. D — 12/07/2021 9:41 AM Novayans have a wholly oral tradition based root culture that adopted or helped make the evolving Perimeter Standard language, and I can see stuff like this being important. Caffeine Delusions — 12/07/2021 9:42 AM Or the flipside of that, a Novayan woman meets a male she thought she\'d never see again, and offers him a braid in turn. D — 12/07/2021 9:42 AM Makes sense. Novayans are interested in breeding with important big dudes, but they don\'t really have the same family structures or care much about the male\'s participation otherwise. D — 12/07/2021 9:44 AM I\'m loving this Space Puss-in-Boots/Novayans are dashing space adventurers thing I am doing. It\'s the most I\'ve ever done with Novayans. D — 12/07/2021 9:46 AM Novayans (as individuals) were already well established in the Perimeter trade lanes and continued spacing after humans took it over. There is probably a ton of culture that had to get adapted to. D — 12/07/2021 9:48 AM I\'m betting there is a form of "kandi" too (the patch/pin/DIY thing social currency among spacers) that indicates one is accepted by Novayans, if one has enough of them, because it\'s a specific Novayan thing. D — 12/07/2021 9:55 AM It meshes particularly well with Novayans given that Novayans offworld don\'t identify with specific culture groupings, they\'re individuals who form group bonds of other individuals. (Their world has weird biologically based gender politics but they don\'t at all map those to humans. "Human males aren\'t real males. They don\'t even have barbs! Their females don\'t estrus!") D — 12/07/2021 9:56 AM Just as onworld, culture identity is completely about singing your long list of mothers and fathers, there isn\'t really anything that\'s identified as big culture group (apart from "I\'m a Novayan".) (edited) D — 12/07/2021 9:56 AM I think that some Novayans adopt non-Novayans, and are adopted by them. Caffeine Delusions — 12/07/2021 9:56 AM Little Novayan girl gets declared Jewish by human boss. Does Not Know How To Handle This. D — 12/07/2021 9:58 AM ...oh, having a candy that identifies the identity of the person who gave it, on your clothes, say, a Novayan who has a chai, it means it was a gift and it means they\'re considered an ally. Nice! D — 12/07/2021 10:01 AM I\'m liking the contrast too how the extremely individualistic Novayans are as fundamental a part of Perimeter Spacer culture, as the partially hive mind, eusocial Myrmidons were among the early shock troops for Earth, though Earth fucked em. (Via their own natural order following nature.) Caffeine Delusions — 12/07/2021 10:24 AM This is inevitably going to end with Novayans getting Woven by their human family. Jump D — 12/07/2021 10:27 AM Humans have worked the Perimeter for about four generations, possibly, and the Co-Op has been a force for about three (the previous generation fought some of the hardest struggles), though its underground roots were around before it became a big thing. Good god, if the takeover of spacing by the Co-Op in the earlier days was some kind of thing that organically grew out of human/Novayan friendships on the ships they worked... that would be interesting. D — 12/07/2021 10:33 AM adding some Novayan connections to Sparks\' sheet. What\'s going to come off though is relatively few human ones. setting-politics-and-government-stuff D — 12/08/2021 4:48 PM You know, @Caffeine Delusions? It may be that Krayahan Nadiran become part of the tapestry of Co-Op spacer life, much as Novayans were from the beginning. D — 12/08/2021 4:52 PM It would be interesting to get back to the Co-Op in 100 years and see what Nadiran stuff ended up absorbed into their bigger tapestry, much the way that Novayan stuff ended up adopted early on. (edited) history-2000s-to-2300s D — 12/08/2021 8:40 PM ...but Novayans were happy to join the better protection racket fairly early on. D — 12/08/2021 8:40 PM Also humans and Novayans had been spacing together since humans had arrived here. welcome D — 12/09/2021 10:43 AM Maybe braided with colored thread. I\'m gonna say it\'s a Novayan thing spacers first picked up, that spread, as humans came to the Perimeter to find Novayans already working the lanes. Not everyone does it or wants to. Adult male Novayans can grow magnificent manes so it\'s something initially specific to adult males that just kind of changed context and became something else as it broadened. D — 12/09/2021 10:44 AM One thing is that given what happens to Novayan males around the scent of female estrus, they may have found it easier to form permanent friendships and found family with humans. D — 12/09/2021 2:32 PM It may have been picked up from Novayans, but given the person to person spread of culture and deep meaning of personal network social signifiers to Perimeter culture, I\'m going to say it spread out from the first humans who befriended novayans, and kept it going with other people. future-slang D — 12/15/2021 9:21 AM Yep, because an actual average person operating in Co-Op space if human or novayan has their tribal markers and ratings and fam candy and any other experienced person in that culture can read it at a glance D — 12/15/2021 6:17 PM (Novayans don\'t particularly care about being called cats, and the power dynamic is different with Novayans most of whom are autonomous agents; and they\'ll happily spray your belongings or even fight you if you left a bad impression. "Pelt" is bad though and implies threat.) (edited) logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 12/22/2021 7:37 PM Weave/braid (r\'khatha): syncretic Novayan/human custom, a bracelet woven of hair that is gifted to someone who is treated as kin. It is not known at this point which species started this custom; it could have begun on the space lanes and traveled with Novayans back to their home, or it could have begun on Novaya. It may have its roots in an older Novayan brotherhood rite which has been supplanted by the newer syncretic custom as the Novayans have participated in the interstellar community. (Thinking that this is often encased in some kind of protective thing? Some Novayans who work for wealthy employers outside of Co-Op space, may wear gold bangles that are hollow inside and contain their weaves. And some high status Novayans might have something like this.) D — 12/22/2021 7:41 PM That may have been a Novayan thing even long before it was a human thing. Novayans have worked beside spacefaring cultures for long enough to have customs and songs about it. Caffeine Delusions — 12/22/2021 7:41 PM Yeah, but Novayans didn\'t have the Library trying to create a genetic tapestry of human history and culture. D — 12/22/2021 7:42 PM Question is, what do bloodlines mean to Novayans. D — 12/22/2021 7:51 PM ...I wouldn\'t be surprised if the Novayan originating custom has something that looked different originally, given it might have been made of felted fur, whereas the human version became braided hair. D — 12/22/2021 7:52 PM One way it may differ, the human braid vs the Novayan r\'khatha, is that to Novayans it\'s used specifically with their hunt-brotherhood construct, whereas scaled to humans it came to contain (and track) all kinds of other close relationships. Caffeine Delusions — 12/24/2021 10:09 AM Heck, it wouldn\'t surprise me in the least if Novayans and some Krayahan ended up getting Woven simply because their stories meaningfully intersected with human stories. spacers-space-setting D — 12/24/2021 11:09 AM The integration of Novayans into the Co-Op absolutely would\'ve played a role too. And I\'m sure that advanced fabrication allows a certain degree of manufacture on sight general-bullshit D — 12/25/2021 8:59 AM How would a relationship between a Novayan and a human work, do you think? D — 12/25/2021 8:59 AM First the question everyone wants to know. Can they fuck. (Anyone and a Novayan female, certainly. Uh... but could a human do it with someone that basically has a scaled up cat dick?) (edited) D — 12/25/2021 9:02 AM But secondly, I\'m just brainstorming how this would work, given what little I\'ve figured about Novayan offworld life. Cats can be bonded pairs, so I imagine Novayans can, too. A relationship with a human and a Novayan may involve rough play/sparring and sitting around grooming each other. I\'d bet that Novayans who are exceptionally well groomed, it\'s taken as a sign of being cared for. Message could not be loaded. D — 12/25/2021 10:19 AM In fact I wouldn\'t be surprised if Novayan males have more opportunity with aliens, or other Novayan males, than with females of their own kind. D — 12/25/2021 10:23 AM I actually kinda thought of that because I was imagining Novayans doing humans\' hair, then realized that potentially had some... optics. D — 12/25/2021 10:47 AM ...and given Novayan styling is based on a mane. good point. Jump D — 12/25/2021 11:33 AM Anyway so it\'s seeming like humans and Novayans, especially in the spacer lifestyle, have relationships, someone might sometimes occasionally even grow up with a Novayan stepparent or uncle/aunt figure, and that adds a layer of depth to this relationship doesn\'t it. D — 12/25/2021 11:41 AM Ok, new fucked up shit in this character\'s life. She lost a love, probably an early one at that. Male, but Novayan, and over Novayan bullshit. D — 12/25/2021 11:42 AM Shanked by another Novayan male when there was a female in estrus present. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/25/2021 8:47 PM He\'s dressed for fun times there,, but he was a rated navigator and transport pilot, worked with Sparks, was her (possibly only) significant other. Novayan males\' #1 cause of death is other Novayan males. (edited) Message could not be loaded. IsaacSapphire — 12/25/2021 9:11 PM Novayan on novayan crime? D — 12/25/2021 9:20 PM Novayan mating drive is so strong that males often kill each other over the insanity that the female pheromones cause, and females going offworld often take meds to stop estrus. The gay males probably are the ones that get to stick around. (edited) Message could not be loaded. D — 12/25/2021 9:36 PM Another case where Viking/Celtic influenced optics for the Novayans may be a smart choice. (edited) D — 12/26/2021 10:04 AM Fits with all ownership being in the female line with Novayans. D — 12/26/2021 10:07 AM Like, men being pitted against each other in social status contests for survival because they don\'t have a guaranteed space in their own culture the way the female land holders and their female family members do and can only attain some small part of this by being a female\'s favorite. I really feel the Novayans may keep the gays around though. D — 12/26/2021 10:30 AM Could be a thing where lots of young Novayan males simply nope out and work offworld. That\'s what im beginning to think. Doesn\'t mean they won\'t fight over females they encounter though. Wouldn\'t be surprised if lots of space services require female workers to take a pheromone suppressant med. D — 12/26/2021 10:50 AM I\'m imagining a young Novayan male spacer falling in love with a human female, and it\'s the autistic coded young woman who stayed in the engine room, or in their bunk, studying, when everyone else was carousing. Because Cats. D — 12/26/2021 10:55 AM Everyone always wants to party with the Novayan, but think about who cats always want attention from in a group. D — 12/26/2021 11:39 AM Yet I can also see the kids climbing all over the Novayan, too D — 12/26/2021 12:30 PM Depends upon where it happened. If on a trip home, in Novayan space, who knows. It was about 15 years ago give or take so it\'s possible he met his own shitty Novayan end. D — 12/26/2021 12:31 PM Novayan male life is nasty, brutish, and short on the whole, think of a tomcat\'s quality of life, and when they started having the Co-Op to work with as their spacing company, they were among the most enthusiastic adopters. D — 12/26/2021 12:40 PM @IsaacSapphire I can see some Novayan males opting for castration if they\'re someone who is really devoted to a craft or intellectual pursuit and don\'t particularly want to take their chances on the life of a free intact male. future-slang D — 12/28/2021 3:45 PM The Ways A poetic term, alluded to in Novayan song (the actual term would be in the Novayan language), for the "Conduits" - the gate system. It became the term for this gate system as so named by the crew of DSES-4 on the first trip through. (edited) aliens D — 12/28/2021 3:56 PM I\'m loving the Novayans ngl. D — 12/28/2021 3:57 PM They feel and express so many of the things that were beaten out of humanity, the Novayan spacers are just so unabashedly themselves, and... I think this was good for the humans that worked with them, and befriended them. (edited) aesthetic-and-mood-board-stuff D — 12/29/2021 3:49 PM Tempted to make the Novayans a nod, appearance wise, to CJ Cherryh\'s Hani (from the Chanur novels). logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 12/29/2021 10:09 PM Possible it’s a Novayan thing? D — 12/29/2021 10:10 PM Cuz I’m imagining Novayans with all kinds of funky tribal looking tats. D — 12/29/2021 10:13 PM Could be a thing humans borrowed and Sparks’ could even be a Novayan “bro” mark D — 12/29/2021 10:14 PM Especially if she has extended Novayan fam Maybe for Novayans it\'s more like a ritually applied (and re-applied) staining agent, but doing the same symbols as tats is a human adaptation. Jump D — 12/30/2021 11:10 AM It\'s interesting to me to contrast btw these repressed, embittered older humans with the expressive Novayans, who have so many ways to express grief and joy and friendship Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:12 AM Well, yes, but also this is the SECOND cat meme that we\'ve managed to Novayanize. Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:14 AM Yes, possibly, but what I\'m getting at is that what if Novayan culture is in many ways just an active reframing of things that the audience recognizes as lolcats and the memes descended from lolcats? Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:15 AM Novayan deity looks down on their culture through a hole in the sky of the world. Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:16 AM Novayans requesting cheeseburgers. Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:16 AM Novayans developing an inexplicable fondness for small portions of salami. Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:16 AM Novayans scared of zucchini. Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:17 AM NOVAYAN MIETTE! Caffeine Delusions — 12/30/2021 11:21 AM Novayans may even have a formalized ritual practice of accusing others of wrongdoing. Something consisting of \'Inquisition, comparison, proposed punishment, proposed term.\' D — 12/30/2021 11:21 AM Because Novayans are also impulsive, emotional, and sometimes, egotistical. They definitely do things for self aggrandizement. D — 12/30/2021 11:22 AM ...can you imagine Novayans in a Shakespearian acting troupe D — 12/30/2021 11:30 AM For whatever counts as Novayan hell. D — 12/30/2021 11:37 AM What if Novayans have a thing where one Novayan can ritually complete their dead brother\'s quest and give them credit for it? D — 12/30/2021 11:41 AM ...maybe R\'Kesh dreamed of flying with the mission that found the storied Ways across the Void. (Extension of Novayan beliefs about roads and track ways on their world, I\'m gonna say.) And being able to sing about it. (edited) D — 12/30/2021 11:42 AM When Sparks hurtled through the gate, and returned, that\'s what she chose to call it, for the Novayans who\'d sought them for so long - not for conquest, but out of species based insane wanderlust, and because they were there. D — 12/30/2021 11:47 AM Probably lots of Novayans want to be the one that actually gets to see this or that thing rumored to exist. D — 12/30/2021 3:09 PM Novayan retribution strikes me as swift. D — 12/30/2021 3:10 PM It really strikes me how much the Novayans were allies to the humans out on the Perimeter, from the beginning. D — 12/30/2021 3:12 PM Maybe I need to work in the old school anarchist black cat nod in here somewhere even if it\'s a black furred Novayan being involved somewhere in the early history, in one of the big sabotages of the sleeper ships D — 12/30/2021 3:19 PM Novayans\' ability to have communities while also having individualism, and their cultural customs around tribe and friendship, were an influence on human Perimeter spacer culture from the start - there\'s no prying us apart without unraveling the greater whole we\'ve made, i feel. (edited) D — 12/30/2021 6:49 PM What if it signifies that someone carried out a life quest of another person, to Novayans. D — 12/30/2021 6:59 PM Novayan spacers love face tats, you can see them through the visor. D — 12/30/2021 7:55 PM Anyway, I think someone having a completed life quest of a Novayan, is something Novayans would see and understand. (edited) aliens D — 12/30/2021 10:35 PM Do Novayans purr? Is that too much or should I just lean into everything about them that\'s already too much? D — 12/31/2021 6:41 AM Plenty of humans loved Novayans, but more enjoyed them casually. They had a reputation: sooner or later, the urge to wander would take over, and the Novayan would be off on his next flight. It was well known. A Novayan male’s life was his and his alone, if even on his own world, that life risked being nasty, brutish, and short. From the first day that their quick, light feet took them to the new spaceport the Nadiran had built on their world, they’d set another path to wander, seeking their Guides among the stars themselves. And when the Nadiran left, and the Men (as the Nadiran called them) came – the terms were amenable, and more Novayans wandered offworld than ever before. Usually they came back – even if they were no match for some of the older, tougher males living outside the villages, females actually preferred a throat full of songs and a chest, back, and face full of the cut and inked glyphs of storied deeds among the stars. (edited) Jump D — 12/31/2021 6:42 AM But sometimes they wandered offworld, and stayed away. If they were in a bonded pair – they might never return. They had no control over this whatsoever. One could not help who one loved, and a Novayan who could help that, probably was… broken, or something. But there was this. Within an actual pair, a male could potentially live longer, could have a much better life, especially if their partner were intelligent and nimble and strong. Be that partner male or female, that did not matter offworld, though if female – and given good hunting territory – they might form a clan of their own. There were more males offworld, so there were plenty of Novayan male bonded pairs who worked the lanes together. D — 12/31/2021 6:42 AM But a non-Novayan, now? That was not unheard of, either. From the time the first Novayans left their world, they had taken up with aliens. Their reserved, imperious Nadiran employers had no interest in them, and the feeling was mutual. The Altikhari warriors who worked the lanes with them, sometimes took them to bed for a night, but it wasn’t much more than that, and… the preferences of Altikhari could be… unique even by cat standards, and we will just leave it at that. But then humans arrived. And inevitably, sometimes Novayans took up with them. Humans proved to be even more fickle than Novayans had the reputation for being. But not always. And anyway, Novayans loved who they loved, and they had no say over this, just as they had no say in the matters of their ancestral Guides who shined down on them from above. To be disappointed in love was as worthy of poetry and song as to win at it. Only a broken Novayan never dared. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/31/2021 9:15 AM ok, R\'Kesh (dead love) was a navigator. (And I\'m going to hazard to guess that this is a common Novayan specialization. Something they even hold in esteem. You may see Novayan pilots a lot, too.) aliens D — 12/31/2021 5:21 PM more Novayan notes... D — 12/31/2021 5:21 PM At first, I didn’t think anything of the new group of people that got onboarded at Perimeter One. There were two Novayans in this manifest: brothers K’Ratha and R’Kesh. I’d flown with K’Ratha before, he had the callsign “Catnip.” I rolled my eyes every time I heard it, I think I’m the one person who actually just used his name, and he seemed both dumb enough to think I actually accepted his presence and dumb enough to be happy that having even a stupid callsign meant he was no longer thought of as an FNG, even if in the beginning, he was surprised that his tail and mane didn’t buy him automatic cred on the space lanes. Obnoxious twat. So when he came on board at my next flight with his surprisingly quiet brother, R’Kesh, I was surprised that the two brothers couldn’t be more different. Thank Space because I can’t imagine actually working in close quarters with two of K’Ratha. One is amusing at times, but more than enough. D — 12/31/2021 5:22 PM They started arguing as soon as they were in the engine room. To anyone who didn’t understand Novayan it would sound incomprehensibly guttural but I caught “why do you have to be a walking stereotype” hissed from between R’Kesh’s sharp teeth, and it seemed to be in reference to a few things: K’Ratha’s willingness to have personal arguments in public, and his party animal lifestyle. Finally I turned and yelled at the two furballs to take their shit elsewhere. I sat quietly going over the updated department manifest and after K’Ratha stomped off. R’Kesh seemed happy to just go about his business and get shown the lay of the land by the head nav. aesthetic-and-mood-board-stuff D — 01/01/2022 11:37 AM Granted, I can\'t see female Novayans having boobs. aliens D — 01/01/2022 1:22 PM @Caffeine Delusions I think it\'s likely the Novayans are the culture, in setting, that has space songlines. (edited) D — 01/01/2022 1:24 PM New developments: There is a special cultural caste called Wanderers (those - mostly intact males, but not always - who live outside of the female/mother-dominated interior ring of society). They have lore about their world\'s trackways and roads and crossroads and probably special songs related to them... but they have some very very ancient ones that seem to poetically relate to space, and hint that they may not be native to their world. And of course when spacefaring cultures began trading in the Novayans\' home system, they found a place on the Perimeter as spacers (especially pilots and navigators, often security thugs) and pirates and privateers... a natural cultural extension, of course, of being Wanderer.

Humanity\'s dealings with the Novayans at this point were still relatively sparse. As Starfang had been boarded by deep space earth forces, R\'Kalrath stood at her post, and made a quick last-ditch decision, as the boots stomped toward her booth... with the last few minutes of life probably left to her, she popped the seals on the cryo-beds of the prison ships and labor transports. Then she turned and ran at the space marines, with a lusty blood-curdling yell, and took some to hell with her. Anyway that\'s what the Novayan songs have to tell. It\'s probably been vastly exaggerated for the drama. (edited) D — 01/01/2022 5:41 PM Novayans are nothing if not for the moment. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 01/01/2022 11:21 PM It\'s interesting to see that the people who are the most functional in this environment are the ones who do have something resembling a culture that they were raised in. The ones without that... ones like Val who have no connection to anything at all before leaving, any kind of family history, and little to no extended family. @Caffeine Delusions, I see them as being the ones who readily absorbed the Weave tradition from their Novayan coworkers. In some ways they have more in common with the Novayans they work with than Generation Ship humans living on communes, whom they don\'t. Humanity alone isn\'t enough of a thing to have in common on the lanes. logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 01/01/2022 11:26 PM Novayan face tats and scars are probably more common among human spacers than just Val, there is a lot of cultural syncretism between lots of human and Novayan spacer culture. (Humans from existing face tat backgrounds will have them, of course, you\'re occasionally gonna even see ta moko on someone.) @Caffeine Delusions, how am I doing with pulling this off? I don\'t want to portray that humanity in any way lacked agency, or were anyone\'s client in any way. What I want to get across is that many individual Novayans were our allies. (edited) aliens D — 01/01/2022 11:31 PM Wanderers have their own brotherhoods, non blood kinship systems, lodges, etc. and this all has meaning to Novayans on and offworld. D — 01/02/2022 10:09 AM Novayans don\'t give a shit about privacy. Not one. D — 01/02/2022 10:22 AM I\'m sure that there\'s a bigger history of Novayan spacefaring and that they may have even declined a bit because of working for the Nadiran. They are hoping to recapture something in their spirit and their culture that was lost. Finding the Ways was as important to them, and their future, as it is to humans. But their songs speak of a culture that once vastly traveled space. Though who knows what\'s hyperbole, with them. Their songs exaggerate a lot. They, because of cultural context, know what\'s true in them. (edited) D — 01/02/2022 10:43 AM Also their own social structure consists of a ton of dominance displays in the moment, and pissing contests, but if nothing is really at stake - and there\'s plenty of space - they can walk away. Most don\'t really want to end up in a violent scrap, because violence between Novayans is no joke when it happens. But mating changes the equation, and the biochemical changes that happen make the males hulk out. D — 01/02/2022 10:47 AM It\'s also possible for particular friendship lines among Novayans to dominate some parts of spacing or corners of some professions, and lock Novayans of the wrong friendship lines, or unconnected, out. God, the interrelationships of all of these complicated, flat-hierarchy informal social institutions within spacing life, let alone Co-Op life, will require a freakin\' string chart to map. (edited) D — 01/02/2022 10:50 AM Val doesn\'t have a lot of fam candy pertaining to the things most humans do to have fun, or many humans who would vouch for working with her (she\'s curt and antisocial), but she has some Novayan ink, and that counts for something. (edited) D — 01/02/2022 10:54 AM And it\'s not that weird. There are other human spacers with Novayan ink. But some Novayan-originated traditions, like braiding, took on their own life entirely and scaled to the non-Novayans they worked with. logos-symbols-patches-candy Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:22 PM Biggest way to do that is to show that the cultural bleed goes both ways. What of our traditions did some Novayans jump right into when they got the chance? Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:25 PM I kind of imagine that a lot of Spacegoing Novayan Males don\'t have a lot of experience (and may have a certain amount of hurt/abandonment over the fact) with not really having the whole familial connection. Isn\'t the general reaction in their culture that a male basically gets sent out to do the lonely tomcat thing or get fixed just about as soon as they start reaching puberty? Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:28 PM How\'s a lone Novayan male going to react when he gets invited to the family quarters of one of his human coworkers, meets that coworker\'s grandma, and gets flooded in the typical Italian/Jewish/Russian/Mexican/franklyalotofhumancultureshavetheirmatriarchsdothisIdon\'tknowwhy practice of sticking food on their plate and insisting that they\'re not eating enough? D — 01/02/2022 10:30 PM Ohhh interesting. I\'d have to define what onworld Novayan mealtimes are like, for contrast. Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:30 PM It\'s more like... how do Novayans that have essentially been living the tomcat life react to being MOM\'D. Jump Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:32 PM A Novayan whose famcandy is displayed on a scottish tartan from the human family that adopted him. D — 01/02/2022 10:33 PM Novayans in kilts. Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:33 PM I think if they deal with scottish expats enough, the Expats will establish a Novayan tartan. Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:34 PM That said, I think that most Novayans would feel it more meaningful to wear the Tartan of whichever human clan has accepted them as a surrogate member. D — 01/02/2022 10:35 PM The way Novayans define culture and identity is a very individual experience Caffeine Delusions — 01/02/2022 10:35 PM So the Novayan Tartan would probably be something reserved for Scottish colonies where a whole Novayan family has resettled in that community independent of human clan adoptions. D — 01/02/2022 10:35 PM Sketch of Val with the finalized look of the Novayan quest tattoo Message could not be loaded. D — 01/02/2022 10:37 PM Makes sense. I think you see Novayans pretty much all along the space lanes outside the AWC. D — 01/03/2022 9:38 AM If more humans took up aspects of Novayan culture than vice versa, it speaks a lot to how deeply Novayans were already woven into spacer culture even before humans arrived. D — 01/03/2022 9:39 AM Granted, Novayans like some human clothing styles, and also... our music. general-bullshit D — 01/03/2022 10:39 AM in-setting, it seems to be going the direction of... so many humans at this point have fucked cat people that they\'d know or not and you couldn\'t really joke about it. It could be that the females simply stopped selecting for that. Or it\'s only relevant with estrus-specific procreative mating, and Novayans simply get up to all kinds of other sexual shit. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 01/03/2022 1:34 PM Possibly has one in some of the more "wretched hive of scum and villainy" ports but I think her Novayan face tattoo probably prevents (and probably causes tho) some kinds of trouble among people who know its connected to a specific tribal/faction affiliation. D — 01/03/2022 5:50 PM Wonder if being an initiated member of a Novayan lodge involves carrying anything. D — 01/04/2022 11:14 AM Also in light of our conversations about human/Novayan cultural syncretism, it\'s kind of fun that what may be evolving centuries down the road, is this hybridized diverse human/alien culture (even with some offspring being mixed human/Nadiran) with one common cultural identity but pathways for 1000s of different expressions of family and tribal affiliation. (edited) aliens D — 01/04/2022 2:52 PM I don\'t think Novayan helmets need cat ears, but damn if it isn\'t tempting. D — 01/04/2022 6:39 PM the Hani in Cherryh\'s work have issues with space boots and gloves triggering their claws, but I can\'t imagine that Novayans wouldn\'t just trim them way down. Same as humans. D — 01/04/2022 6:45 PM I get to think up what unique alien features Novayans have that are specifically Novayan, as opposed to just being "humanoid cat." Message could not be loaded. D — 01/04/2022 6:48 PM ...so you may actually see Novayans in bigger, older school bubble-shaped helmets D — 01/04/2022 6:51 PM Cherryh\'s take on her own cat people is that they avoid EVA, but I don\'t intend to copy her. I need to point out that Novayans probably don\'t find spacesuits very comfortable, but... irl, humans really don\'t either. D — 01/05/2022 8:08 AM Novayans\' role in spacing is reminding me a bit of Basque sailors too D — 01/05/2022 8:27 AM but mostly with Novayans, aesthetically... a big mashup of Space Vikings and Space Celts. I\'ll probably use iron age imagery for their traditional village life a bit. D — 01/06/2022 10:11 AM Working on a writeup for the Novayans rn. I should probably come up with some kind of standardized template for the different species. D — 01/06/2022 2:58 PM @Caffeine Delusions "you stab his body like the pincushion" has been living rent free in my head, and now I\'m imagining that lots of metaphors, and "the" instead of "a", may be an element of how Novayans just talk. D — 01/06/2022 7:44 PM His comments about sea shanties makes me think: Novayan navigators are bards. @Caffeine Delusions Renberg\'s deciding that the Novayans deserved the credit for finding the Ways... is rooted in Novayan navigation songs Jump D — 01/07/2022 7:21 AM I\'m thinking that Novayans just didn\'t have the werewithall to look for the Ways themselves, for generations their spacing activity was limited by being a Nadiran feudal lord\'s client state, which came to an end about 6 generations ago, but then it was successive protection rackets. The Co-Op is really the first opportunity they\'ve had to actually participate in spacing as equals to anyone where it didn\'t involve piracy. (edited) D — 01/07/2022 7:25 AM The way I\'m thinking it went down in the end was that when Renberg finished giving her deposition to the assembled people involved, they started arguing over what the anomalies should be called, and she said the Ways - in Novayan, looking from face to face of every Novayan present - and then, in Standard, "the Ways." Which means it needs a Novayan word and fuck I did not know, 30+ years ago, that one day I\'d be conlanging Novayan. (edited) D — 01/07/2022 7:27 AM But anyway... this was an acknowledgement that the Novayans\' songs were navigational lore, part of their long long history as navigators. (I am gonna say that there were many humans - and especially the oldest, most stoic and bitter of the humans, trapped the hardest in their Orphan generational trauma - who didn\'t really acknowledge this and basically saw Novayan beliefs as alien woo woo.) (edited) D — 01/07/2022 7:35 AM The thing that\'s important is that humans may have been in deep space because of survival, but Novayans are "joke\'s on you, I\'m into that shit." They\'re here for a good time, by and large. (edited) D — 01/07/2022 7:40 AM Also they\'re carnivorous apex predators. One thing about how their mindset got baked into the Co-Op, that humans needed to acknowledge, is that Novayan social ways don\'t really neatly map to any human conception of power, and they also don\'t farm or herd. D — 01/07/2022 7:44 AM Novayans who\'ve gone Wanderer aren\'t even bound to clan law, because the clan isn\'t responsible for anyone who leaves. You neither speak for your clan nor does it owe you anything. But the tradeoff is that Novayan life, outside the clan, can be short. Other tradeoffs are that Novayan society just hasn\'t really been able to scale as a civilization and they very much depend upon cooperation with other spacefaring cultures to scratch their itch. D — 01/07/2022 7:47 AM It may be that Novayan society just didn\'t get to scale after arriving on the Perimeter, and they had to go more old school and revert to hunting, because one thing I\'m beginning to imply about Novayans is that they\'re not native to their homeworld, and they have old navigational lore, and what if they left their original world on their own? On their own ships, without the help of anyone? (edited) D — 01/07/2022 7:49 AM I may just decide never to explain what the Novayan rise to industry and space-sailing was even like, and leave it a big mystery, and Novayans are more interested in their lore about it, and the future, than trying to go back to the past. (Which was another lesson they taught humans.) D — 01/07/2022 7:50 AM It could even be that Novayans were originally part of a multispecies culture. D — 01/07/2022 7:59 AM The thing with Novayan mindset having an influence on the Co-Op, is that the synergy of species involved very much have a part to play in how things will shape up over time, and how they\'re already shaping up. D — 01/07/2022 8:01 AM But Novayan and human in particular seem like a kind of yin and yang, they need each other. Humans who become spacers are gigantically people descended of basically the Belter trope and those ripped from their homes and families by Weyland-Yutani the megacorps that dominated Solar System industry. (edited) D — 01/07/2022 8:10 AM They have massive generational trauma and had to completely re-invent their culture and what survived to take control of Perimeter shipping, were a dour and pragmatic lot that had little way of reckoning what kinship ties they did get to form, across the light years that separated them from the friends they did make. There are also cultural differences between spacers of sleeper descent, vs the humans with intact Earth ancestral identities. (This is like growing up in a big city that has many different kinds of immigrants. Not like entirely different countries.) And Earth had ground down human abilities to form social bonds or their own institutions independent of the corporations. The Weave - something originally a Novayan concept - and the idea of Novayan Wanderer kinship, and their various lodges and fictive clans, is something that many humans may have just clicked with, and there may be a degree to which the Co-Op absolutely had to be built upon this. It\'s something that was amenable to Novayans from the beginning, and the only way they\'d work with anyone else. When I saw a Novayan face in my head as one of the culture heroes of the rise of the Co-Op, I knew that there was no pulling Novayans from that Weave and having it remain the same. (edited) Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:07 AM There are elements of the Weave that definitely started Novayan as a cultural tradition, but I maintain that the concept of The Weave as the Library uses it (as a storage and organizational system for knowledge and cultural legacy) is in fact purely the Library\'s innovation. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:17 AM See, the thing is with Novayans, I think Weaving was about individual communication in one-on-one relationships. You wore YOUR Weave when you put on all the individual trinkets and braids that you\'d gathered as a way to tie you to all the people you knew, which may have conceptually influenced the spacer concept of famcandy... but for them, there wasn\'t ONE Weave that incorporated everybody, there were at least as many weaves as there were people. It was the Library, longing for a way to remind humanity of its roots and its legacy and everything it had been ripped away from, looking to organize the art it had smuggled off Earth and connect it to the people yearning for the cultures and history and identity they\'d been orphaned from, who began doing something on the macro scale. The Library probably didn\'t even call it the Weave themselves, originally. Some Novayan got brought into one of their Libraries with a human co-worker and their kid and saw the interface in action, and then went... "It\'s... your Weave. It\'s HUMANITY\'S Weave. One Weave for ALL of you...." and was gobstruck, and then it just kinda stuck. D — 01/07/2022 10:19 AM Makes sense and I think that there are some bigger Weaves Novayans had too, like, your particular Wanderer brotherhood or lodge. D — 01/07/2022 10:21 AM Humans and Novayans just happen to have worked together long enough as equals to rub off on each other. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:22 AM The fact that Novayans took one look at it and immediately had a term for it, but had never considered doing it quite the same way humans had is in some ways a testament to the fact that both cultures have walked the same roads at different times, and something about their journeys created commonalities between them. D — 01/07/2022 10:24 AM ...and judging by the number of Novayans you see with what look like punk/metalhead jackets, some with patches for human music acts, I\'d say the cultural exchange goes both ways. D — 01/07/2022 10:31 AM It also allows for the possibility of 1) the Novayan homeworld being out there somewhere, which is a good planet-of-the-week story and 2) Novayans having catfolk cousins in various places so if somebody wanted to expy a catfolk character from some other setting or just who isn\'t Novayan, they could. D — 01/07/2022 10:35 AM It struck me more and more as I started to flesh out in my head, the relationship between Val and R\'Kesh, that it to some degree could be meta on humans and Novayans and gives me a lot of opportunity to explore that. His brother K\'Ratha is the himbo, and the one who hops from rack to rack on every trip, R\'Kesh (navigator) is the poet. D — 01/07/2022 10:38 AM Btw. Her tattoos? They mean she\'s connected to an extended Novayan family, that\'s the bigger chunk of her fam candy. (edited) D — 01/07/2022 10:39 AM They have short fur on their faces and on parts of their bodies that won\'t grow in places where it\'s scarred, so you see Novayans with all kinds of tribal looking marks, combo of scarification and ink. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:41 AM J\'ORTZ DOES NOT DESERVE THESE PERVERSE CLAIMS, MUTUAL GROOMING IS A TIME HONORED NOVAYAN TRADITION AND IT IS NOT SEXUAL IN NATURE. D — 01/07/2022 10:41 AM I have to imagine how Novayan and human relationships actually work and... I\'m just glad I know furries at this point in time. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:43 AM Actually, I\'m picturing Val getting pulled in by a trio of Novayan Girly Girls because they happen to be from whatever extended family she\'s tied to, and her having to do the polite thing and participate in the mutual grooming and bonding as they get to know her. Possibly it culturally codes to dragging a friend of a friend on a spa day so you can learn about each other. Jump Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:56 AM I mean, it\'s not unreasonable to say that her mark indicates both that she\'s a member of this wanderer\'s lodge AND that she\'s mated into a Novayan clan through a member that has been lost. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 11:04 AM The clan adoption thing would be a mutual step, which means some Novayan had to figure out how to render Val\'s human family information into Novayan script for R\'Kesh\'s tat. D — 01/07/2022 11:11 AM ...the Novayans probably find the recorded genetic info in the neo-Weave tradition, convenient for them, and avail themselves of it. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 11:13 AM I could actually see Novayans eagerly asking to be incorporated into the Human Weave and the Library going with it on the principle that all knowledge is worthy of preservation. future-slang Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 12:04 PM Fucking Novayans, I tell you what.

Tell me he is wrapping it up, ay?” She almost spit out her bite of salmon and rice, and wiped at her mouth. “Wr… what?” “You know, putting on the- oh. Well. You would have heard, if not.” “Oh. Right.

D — 01/07/2022 6:19 PM I like the idea that actually Val is really girly by Novayan standards. heh. It just doesn\'t scan to human aesthetics. D — 01/07/2022 9:22 PM They have long, expressive tails which aid in balance, but are partially prehensile and can be used to help steady the Novayan in question, such as anchoring a Novayan technician to a handhold in a micrograv situation, leaving his hands free. D — 01/07/2022 9:38 PM Declawing is something sometimes done to Novayans by asshole captors and it\'s exactly what it is to kitties, it\'s amputating the tips of their fingers. And they use their claws extensively outside of artificial environments like spacecraft for various things. (edited) character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 01/08/2022 10:09 AM A thing i\'m hashing out for Val\'s arc, before taking the Flight, is that there are potentially dicey optics in terms of "human solves problem for aliens that aliens couldn\'t solve for themselves." I think she took the tabby marks before making the wormhole dive, and finally got the cooperation of her syndicate after forming those alliances with the Novayans, and the big thing is that it was a joint effort every bit requiring the participation of every person on DSES-4 even while she was taking Alvin through the hole. But it very much took into account the navigational information provided by the Novayans, and a significant number of Novayans were involved in the project. There\'s going to be something that goes wrong with some piece of technology that requires her specifically to make the wormhole dive (I think their ansible terminal got sucked in, and sputtered out... she got on the other side and brought it back online, and replied back to DSES-4 from the other side of the wormhole), but everything is indicating to me that she had the tabby marks when she took the dive (if only because I want the visual of them visible through the helmet visor in the art). She could not even begin to play nice enough with the Co-Op to get anyone to work with her, up to this point, and it was working against her. But now she had the support of at least the people in her lodge, including some humans who were members of the same Novayan lodge. And the tabby marks and Novayan tattoos (including the one showing she went through a grief ritual with the other Wanderers) indicated to Novayans that she was at least somewhat Trustable. (She may have been too socially cut off up to this point to really grasp how much belonging to a lodge, faction, even a Social Syndicate, etc, could play a part in Co-Op life.) Thing with Novayan marks is that you wouldn\'t have them, and actually display them properly, if you didn\'t undergo the corresponding rite with the Novayans involved. (edited) future-slang D — 01/08/2022 10:31 AM Tabby Marks Human slang for Novayan face tats that signify specific fictive kinship ties and experiences. There are some factions that are mostly human, but have a Novayan founder, that have them. It implies also the willingness to give or shed blood for the people you\'ve taken the mark with. (edited) character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 01/08/2022 10:37 AM Also I may make the specific point that she\'s not the first human to form meaningful relationships with Novayans, or be adopted into a Wanderer lodge, and that this is a meaningful part of the early history of the Co-Op as well. The Novayan Wanderer thing of forming your kinship ties based upon your common task was very, very much a parallel thing to human ideas of solidarity, it\'s just... Novayans are just so much less grim about the whole affair. logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 01/08/2022 10:54 AM Tabby Marks - xposting here from Future Slang - human nickname for the face marks Novayans (and some humans) take that show complex fictive kinship ties to Novayan Wanderer groupings. Lots of humans have various Novayan marks, to actually be recognizable at a glance as Wanderer is another matter though. But it\'s not unheard of with humans and Val is simply one of a larger handful of humans at any time that have this, and nobody even knows who the first was. There are assumed responsibilities that come with having the marks. (edited) D — 01/08/2022 11:02 AM Novayan marks are rendered in the traditional Novayan way, with blade and powdered ink, and in the case of Novayans, with the area being shaven first. On a Novayan, the fur won\'t grow back over the mark. Also the fur is shorter on their faces and on many parts of their body, than on other parts. (edited) D — 01/08/2022 12:46 PM The big irony is that to a Novayan, she is a girly girl. I really want to play with that stuff being cultural. aliens D — 01/08/2022 2:15 PM One thing that\'s going to get confirmed is that their original homeworld is indeed on the other side of one or more of the wormholes. I mean, at some point you could meet other cat people, maybe find a Novayan burial that predates Novayans on Novaya. Or an old sailship wreck. But this is what the Novayans have to say: "We have sailed these stars for a long time, and you tell of it in your stories." Finally: Wanderers have a special belief... that their ancestors, and those who\'ve gone before, shine down on them from the stars. To be remembered as having walked the shining path into the night, and to sing back to the people your stories of having done so, is to become guide to the next generation of Wanderers. D — 01/08/2022 2:20 PM ...and it\'s interesting to look at what it\'s like to be a Nadiran client state from the other side. They were a client state for hundreds of years and while the Nadiran definitely employed them in space (much of it mining the system for the resources the Nadiran trade) and installed local shipping, on the homeworld, their culture reverted completely to traditional industry and fell behind. They lost their ability to build their own ships. The Nadiran walked away several generations ago, then it was a violent period with a series of rackets and pirate states, and finally, the Co-Op moved into their space. Which is actually the first time so many Novayans been able to participate as equals in spacing since arriving in this part of space, short of being pirates. (And there are a ton of Novayan pirates.) The tails were probably already in use in industry in the region, given Novayans were already there when humans got there. Jump IsaacSapphire — 01/08/2022 3:09 PM I wonder if there was drama about tail prosthetics and the people who use them being too like Novayans general-bullshit D — 01/09/2022 9:45 AM Something I have fun with is the idea that masculinity/femininity attributes are partially cultural and my Novayan character R\'Kesh definitely sees his very butchy human girlfriend as a girly girl. (edited) D — 01/09/2022 10:00 AM Though among Novayans that actually has a couple of specific triggers. D — 01/09/2022 11:02 AM It\'s possible that the most hulked out, super aggressive Novayan males actually aren\'t as useful in their society and the females tend to use them to induce ovulation but keep the nicer males around, and the nicer males actually pass on their genes more. D — 01/09/2022 11:06 AM ...Novayans being carnivorous apex predators, who don\'t require access to a group to feed themselves or survive in the wild long enough to pass on their genes (not ideal given their gregarious nature, but they can do it), has an impact on how governable they are Caffeine Delusions — 01/09/2022 11:11 AM I\'m reminded of real life cats and how they raise kittens communally, and how any human involved is seen as part of the community, so if a kitten gets dropped into your lap, congratulations you\'re co-parenting now. I wonder how that translates into blended Novayan/Human communities. Caffeine Delusions — 01/09/2022 11:13 AM Do the Novayans just automatically assume they have co-parenting responsibilities for human kids? Do they foist off Novayan cubs on humans who aren\'t expecting it? What kind of accommodations have to be made to get the two different cultural child rearing styles to mesh? D — 01/09/2022 11:13 AM There is backstory i wrote about the Nadiran prefect who is seen as the great reformer, spent a couple of years as a boy living among Novayans after surviving a wreck on a world that some Novayans were living on. D — 01/09/2022 11:19 AM ...what if baby Novayans look like cubs D — 01/09/2022 11:21 AM I think you see Novayans running on fours more when they\'re in Frenzy. language-and-sundry D — 01/09/2022 3:54 PM “You like that I hit my brother for you for making the sex in your hab every night, ay? If you like, R’Kesh hits him like the punching bag. One thousand times for K’Ratha.” “Yes,” Sparks said, between bites of her food. “Go ahead. Beat the shit out of him. I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep since habmates started passing him like a doob. Fuckin’ tomcat.” “The tomcat who is going to get himself killed extra-dead one day,” R’Kesh replied. He looked down at the remaining ration of salmon cubes in his tray. “Novayan male life span, sometimes not that great. Tell me he is wrapping it up, ay?” Sparks suddenly coughed momentarily, and almost spit out her bite of salmon cubes with rehydrated seaweed and rice, and wiped at her mouth. “Wr… what? How do I know?” “You know, putting on the- oh. Well. You would have heard, if not.” “Oh. Right. Ah,” she managed, “Yeah, sure I would’ve. Look, your brother needs to meet his friends in the hold.” “Prefers the gravity… nnh, can’t say I blame him,” R’Kesh said, and he paused, thoughtfully. “But I will tell him. We cannot have the ship break because the engineer is short of sleep.” “Apprentice. There’s five more in front of me. The ship’s fine.” “Oh, that is \\*much\\* worse, then. The ship need all the help it can get.” (edited) D — 01/09/2022 3:54 PM Getting a sense for how Novayans talk. history-2000s-to-2300s D — 01/11/2022 8:17 AM A thing coming up is that the Novayan spacers that humans travel with are adventurers and bards as opposed to merely survivors, and the younger generation coming up are dreamers, and this matters for the future. (edited) general-bullshit D — 01/11/2022 12:17 PM Some Novayans knew navigation songs that weren\'t taken very seriously outside of their culture, and that they themselves didn\'t have the space tech to check out. human-culture-stuff D — 01/11/2022 8:46 PM They\'re not the only fully sovereign entity that has some kind of deal where the Co-Op is their sole (legit) spacing entity, the Novayans have that too. aliens D — 01/11/2022 10:19 PM Novayans, descendants of crepuscular apex predators, favor the twilight and dawn as when their senses are sharpest... but the night holds something special for them. (edited) D — 01/11/2022 10:35 PM Novayans walk a duality between calm abiding and brutality, and can make coldly calculated decisions as well, and be cunning strategists, and passionate bards, and tender, playful, opinionated parents, friends, lovers. But one of the decisions they must all make, that they accept on initiating into adulthood, is that sometimes it\'s necessary to slay another Novayan who\'s in frenzy. D — 01/11/2022 10:44 PM Novayan society is one of strict rules, etiquettes, and rules about territory. It\'s something that scaled well to adapting to spaceflight. (edited) D — 01/11/2022 10:53 PM Somebody way back when basically had no Prime Directive. And Novayans weren\'t scared in the least. The Novayans had the upper hand in the situation, possibly. general-bullshit D — 01/12/2022 10:31 PM The Novayans aren\'t anywhere near as afraid, for one, they have shorter lives, for another, their reproduction is very efficient and successful. So they\'re much more "hold my beer" about lots. D — 01/12/2022 10:35 PM ...you weren\'t here for the "Novayan warrior monks" discussion earlier. D — 01/13/2022 11:07 AM ...my brain can\'t unstick from the idea of Novayan plushies. D — 01/13/2022 11:07 AM @Caffeine Delusions, Novayan plushies. Caffeine Delusions — 01/13/2022 5:13 PM How do the Novayans feel about the plushies? Cut-ear Slang for Novayan male who\'s been castrated. The status is obvious to other Novayans, and important. Eunuchs often act as diplomats, teachers, seers, and can travel across the various boundaries of Novayan society that intact males and females can\'t. A significant number of Novayan males choose this, as the life of an intact Wanderer can be short and brutal, and everyone isn\'t going to ever be a Champion (or survive long enough to become that, once they commit to that course).

Many of them, depending upon what role in society they have (longest lived will be clan mothers, seers, cut-ears) live longer than others, but a significant number (outsiders/outcasts, Wanderers, intact males) have got to know that their life could be cut short.

They\'re a society. They\'re a society which has traveled the spaceways for more generations than we have, and even though it has reverted into some primitivism during their time as a Nadiran client state, their devotion to their self-discipline and self-respect, and their insistence that other Novayans around them respect them, has become even more important. Novayan culture involves a lot of signifying and figurative (and sometimes literal) pissing contests), but it rarely devolves into outright violence. Still, there is always the little edge of danger, even though Frenzy isn\'t nearly as common as one would believe. For most males (and some females), it\'s the choice between being a killer in control of himself vs a mindless animal and rapist who is only fit for living in the wild, who will be put down like a rabid dog by civilized Novayans. They also, I think, to some degree, see themselves as the caretaker of their environment. Many of their social rules are about rules governing their hunting grounds. Another thing is that because they can subsist off of hunt kill, they are remarkably good colonizers of wild spaces where they can be an apex predator. (But their society has rules about this, they don\'t want to just overbreed and run amok. They have cultural nightmares about that kind of thing. It\'s probably happened before in some spaces and it\'s a cultural nightmare probably expressed in folk stories and songs about the restless dead from that period raging across the land in vengeance of that time, or something - a folk memory of a collective reversion to feralness.

D — 01/14/2022 3:39 PM There\'s often been a problem with some humans not taking Novayans very seriously because of the way that they express themselves and their cultural knowledge in terms of stuff that scans to humans as woo woo. D — 01/14/2022 3:45 PM The exact nature of expression of the bond in the relationship is generally individual to that specific bond. This relationship is a separate entity from the animalistic seasonal reproductive matings which can involve blacking out and basically aren\'t consensual for any of the people involved. It\'s gonna be treated like a feral beast basically just possessing you. (And Novayans in control of themselves, are practically authorized to shoot that dude down like a dog. They are not a Person anymore, they are basically a feral animal that poses a danger to themselves, their world, and others.) (edited) D — 01/14/2022 3:49 PM Novayans become deeply depressed when someone close to them dies. Part of their grief rituals involve a processing, together, of loss on the part of the community, and performing specific rituals to acknowledge that person becoming one of the Shining Ones. D — 01/14/2022 3:59 PM I think there is a thing with Novayans too of a ritual of rebirth on the part of the bereaved. D — 01/14/2022 4:06 PM Finally: Novayans lounge around naked most of the time, though sometimes if it\'s a casual social thing you\'ll see robes, wraps, kilts.

D — 01/19/2022 5:59 PM ...maybe you need to use a ringdrive in the holes and navigate through. FTL may be a complementary tech to this. She went through in a one person pod.

But I spent more time worldbuilding the Novayans while you were away. D — 01/23/2022 10:47 PM Plus at some point you will see Novayan privateers. Females on clanships.

D — 01/23/2022 11:36 PM Something that came up in the Novayan duality for me is that they can be gentle and tender with their partners, and their kin. The females on a day to day basis - not in frenzy - are actually known for being fiercer. (edited) D — 01/24/2022 10:19 AM There\'s no way that there isn\'t Novayan sailing lore relating to this. Some of it lost though and fragmentary. Probably songs are what remain. D — 01/24/2022 8:05 PM Not always trusting each other, living in their own communities… humans and Novayans in particular worked the space lanes together, or engaged in unsavory activities together D — 01/26/2022 11:09 AM The bit about pirates that I\'m reading is making me think a bit more about Novayan history... what if one big thing in Novayan songs about their mythical homeworld... D — 01/26/2022 11:13 AM It\'s possible some of these still exist among Novayans - heck, Val may have R\'Kesh\'s. He might have given it to her. But it\'s possible that the cultural knowledge of the link to Way navigation has been lost over time. D — 01/26/2022 11:25 AM Also, if she ended up with it... the thought is, he may have ended up with it from someone else and given the meaning Novayans attach to so many little things - a person who has that kind of thing, may have a cultural obligation to it, and to the memory of that person. R\'Kesh himself may have been carrying a life quest to find the Ways. D — 01/26/2022 11:26 AM Meaning that her not taking on that life quest, would mean a whole chain of people whose life quests don\'t get fulfilled. The life quest is a way that one Novayan\'s research and life\'s work, get carried on by a successor, and that same Novayan probably themselves stands on the shoulders of those that came before. D — 01/26/2022 12:08 PM This would depend upon whether we\'re going harder or softer with this; if we\'re going a little softer then we could say that the object - we could even call it something like a "waystone" - glows in the presence of certain types of... space woo, and when close to a waymouth it\'ll pick up the... space woo that conventional sensing equipment isn\'t going to pick up. Considering that the Novayans sailed the Ways in really, really comparatively primitive ships with relatively little instrumentation. Jump D — 01/26/2022 12:11 PM Whatever the case may be - the way the Novayans describe their ancestors traveling the stars, sounds nuts to us. "And before we rode sailing ships, we rode dragons!" D — 01/26/2022 1:06 PM @Caffeine Delusions I am liking the idea I\'m getting from the Polynesian navigation, that there may have been orgs or guilds of navigators, probably initiatory songs. What\'s funny is that given Novayan society and the gender makeup of many all-Novayan ships (often one family of females and captained by the matriarch - but I\'m going to have to read Chanur to make sure I can differentiate this from that), historically, that person was probably female. But now it\'s a nearly dead tradition and what\'s left of it, is passed on out of cultural pride. D — 01/26/2022 1:07 PM An intact Novayan male would probably be traveling with outworlders, and a Novayan male traveling with females, is probably cut-ear. Message could not be loaded.

D — 01/27/2022 10:13 PM Wouldn\'t be surprised if Novayans have a courtly love mentality, here is why D — 01/27/2022 10:18 PM But also just having a love interest is treated as worthy by itself, you\'d be a broken Novayan if you didn\'t. D — 01/27/2022 10:19 PM Something some males discovered offworld is that being close to a female who isn\'t even another Novayan, brings them the least into conflict with other males. D — 01/28/2022 9:54 AM This pertains to Novayans and other aliens... how would Co-Op work, particularly being a spacer where you might have to deal with shifts and shift changes in a structured environment, be for species that have different circadian rhythms than ours? D — 01/28/2022 9:55 AM Something I\'ve thought about Novayans is that they don\'t do 8 hour sleep stretches, they break up their sleep cycles over the course of their day. Perhaps they can be more adaptable than that, idk. Caffeine Delusions — 01/28/2022 12:06 PM Balancing circadian rhythmes would actually probably be a huge perk for starship staffing in some ways, and a huge problem in others. It probably impacts the kind of jobs that get routed to various species. For Novayans, it means their ideal positions are ones that get a lot of leadtime, and let them work at their own pace, such as a navigational expert that doesn\'t have to actually be the one flying the ship. Might also be good with troubleshooting engine or computer problems as they come up, because that\'s a case of \'wake up the cat, make them fix the thing, then let the cat go back to sleep\'. Caffeine Delusions — 01/28/2022 12:07 PM The upside is that it means you\'ll always have people who are ready to be active, even if not all of your people can handle long shifts at a post very well. Extended high alerts are probably much harder on Novayans than they are on humans. D — 01/28/2022 12:11 PM I think Novayans may have a shorter actual life expectancy than (unmodified) humans, but it\'s possible that their maturation period is shorter. D — 01/28/2022 12:11 PM Leo tends to show up whenever I\'m talking about Novayans. D — 01/28/2022 12:13 PM It\'s possible too that Novayans, when they sleep, often sleep lightly and can be on their feet in a moment\'s notice, or even nap during idle moments on their job. D — 01/28/2022 12:14 PM ...also something that struck me about Novayans is that they probably have ADHD as a species trait, and it\'s an example of how the Co-Op rating system of schooling can accommodate that. D — 01/28/2022 5:12 PM This seems to work. And of note, Novayans can doze off a little but still be totally attentive to their surroundings and snap to alertness at a moment\'s notice. D — 01/28/2022 5:13 PM Novayan ladies: Big Bads D — 01/29/2022 6:40 PM \\* big female Novayan (I keep picturing, based on Bella the Cat) carried around on a litter. planets-of-the-week-and-various-plot-bunnies D — 01/30/2022 8:58 AM @Caffeine Delusions I\'ve got an interesting thought. Who Val went to, to make the jump. She just ended up stonewalled over and over by the humans in her syndicate - so what if she actually flew with a Novayan-majority crew for it, like, perhaps with a ship of the Watch? Which is not strictly speaking Co-Op but generally acts as an ally? What if she then presented her findings to DSES? aliens D — 01/31/2022 3:59 PM this has implications for Novayans. D — 01/31/2022 4:00 PM Like, intact Novayans normally can be like roided out beasts under the right circumstances. D — 01/31/2022 4:08 PM But in any case, Novayans\' being able to wrap their tails around their partner\'s waist, or use their tail to latch them to something, probably helps. D — 01/31/2022 5:42 PM I\'m gonna say that Novayans are less compromised with moving about in micrograv, they have unique physiological advantages Jump D — 01/31/2022 5:44 PM Also, if long term spaceflight has the effect of levelling male testosterone levels as well as lessening sense of smell, that decreases susceptibility to female Novayan pheromones over time. core-influences-reading-and-watch-list D — 02/01/2022 7:26 PM Need to make sure that I\'m not following too closely to CJ Cherryh\'s Hani with the Novayans. The female clanships may be a little too close. I haven\'t read the books. future-slang D — 02/02/2022 5:09 PM Some Novayans are into it, too, and do historical re-enactments and stuff related to Novayan shit D — 02/02/2022 5:10 PM (There are other aliens about but humans and Novayans, somehow, just have the most in common, there are plenty of Novayans who\'ve taken up human hobbies.) (edited) aliens D — 02/03/2022 7:57 PM Novayan fact of the day... their favorite seasoning profiles are geosmin and umami. Probably enjoy drinks with some degree of geosmin. They\'ll eat anything salty or umami for taste but not necessarily get anything nutritious out of it. They don\'t enjoy sweets. Think they\'ve adapted to spicy or acidic? D — 02/04/2022 8:53 AM ...I also think they use perfumes and such to disguise their pheromones, should I go with some Novayan males smelling like a cologne factory, or is that potentially problematic? D — 02/04/2022 8:56 AM ...maybe make it one or two rare Novayans, plenty just use various soaps (though most of them do like light scents). Let just one or two of them be a cologne disaster. D — 02/04/2022 9:00 AM OK, so, flavors they like... coffee, tea, umami/glutamate. Oh interesting, if they get that much stimulation from greenery around them, they prefer interior environments that are semi landscaped. That said, they like plants but interact with them differently than humans do. Tactility is much more important to a Novayan\'s entertainment and stimulation on the daily than it is to a human\'s. Message could not be loaded. D — 02/04/2022 9:00 AM that\'s how they\'d spot a Novayan who came in off an all-Novayan crew, or it\'s their first flight, or they\'re just a bad seed. D — 02/04/2022 9:01 AM (for reference, it\'s starting to emerge to me that alien politics on the Perimeter, are more aspirational toward Star Wars than Star Trek. There are all kinds of aliens doing all kinds of things, and the Novayans are just a whole spectrum of individuals, decent and not so decent, on all kinds of sides.) D — 02/04/2022 9:03 AM An individual adult Novayan can survive alone in the wild. They\'d just rather not. D — 02/04/2022 9:04 AM I\'m gonna make a thread for random Novayan thoughts that are just crossing my mind atm that aren\'t necessarily related to this random Novayan thoughts D — 02/04/2022 9:05 AM random Novayan thoughts: D — 02/04/2022 9:31 AM ...some of the prettier ones are probably the ones that go offworld, because long term space dwelling seems to tamp down some of their testosterone, they don\'t get into as many stressful situations, etc. Novayans are actually uniquely adapted in some ways to space travel. They\'ve been doing it a lot longer than us... Vyrient — 02/04/2022 9:33 AM By the way, unlike a lot of people, I do consider Judaism a "winning culture" in this sense. Highly resilient and adaptable while maintaining an inner core that stretches recognizably back for a very long time. So, it does not have to be the dominant culture to abide, which can be useful for the Novayans as well. (edited) D — 02/04/2022 10:07 AM Something I came up with for Novayan males is that spacefaring is actually beneficial to their temperaments and long term survival. aliens D — 02/04/2022 10:10 AM And that zone is where I think the Novayan original homeworld probably is. random Novayan thoughts D — 02/04/2022 10:23 AM ...I\'m loving the idea that the Novayans being descended of these swashbuckling lightsailors and rocketeers from deeper coreward, kind of implies... all space cats are valid. It\'s a big enough universe to have produced all visions of cat people. (edited) D — 02/04/2022 10:30 AM oh!!! Declawing a Novayan has GOT to be some kind of punishment done to them by somebody and it\'s probably some organized crime thing. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 02/04/2022 11:01 AM He was a man of the world by Novayan standards, he could easily have even sired kits onworld. Novayan kits, as their male figures go, are raised by their cut-ear uncles more than by their tom fathers. (edited) D — 02/04/2022 11:02 AM It\'s not even being a deadbeat dad by Novayan standards. D — 02/04/2022 11:05 AM Also, for Novayans, he who fucks and runs away, lives to fuck another day. random Novayan thoughts D — 02/04/2022 7:01 PM Novayan origin stuff: D — 02/04/2022 7:02 PM ...in the deeper coreward regions that the most recently discovered Waymouths link to: You\'re going to see lots of schizo tech, and space tyrants with rockets and lightships. And lots of comparatively primitive cultures, and lots of worlds where there are multiple intelligent species living on the same planet. This is the region the Novayans originated in, and they\'ve never been an industrial state - they just learn quickly, and... when an interstellar power tried to come mess with them, they... "yeah. Surely you jest. Thanks for the starship, meatburger. Also, you were tasty." D — 02/05/2022 9:44 AM The wormhole that was discovered, that Val went through, is the one that the Novayans\' ancestors came through. Where it opens up... Jump D — 02/05/2022 9:48 AM The Inmost is a region out past Nadiran space. It\'s the region Novayans came from, of note. D — 02/05/2022 9:59 AM I also know how the Novayans got into space now. general-bullshit D — 02/05/2022 1:06 PM Inspo for regions of space: the Inmost (densely populated region of the Orion Arm, worlds very close together - what\'s on the other side of the Novayan Wormhole) aliens D — 02/06/2022 12:00 PM it makes sense that this is where the Novayans originally came from. Vyrient — 02/06/2022 12:01 PM The Novayans... you might want to leave this a semi-mystery for a while. D — 02/06/2022 12:08 PM I want to leave the Novayans a mystery for a while, too. spacers-space-setting D — 02/08/2022 10:33 PM It\'s a region that\'s totally cut off from Earth, but because of the Ways being accessible by relatively primitive spacefaring tech (e.g., NOT the A-Drive), is responsible ultimately for the origins of the Novayans and Altikhari, though this isn\'t well known. setting-politics-and-government-stuff D — 02/18/2022 10:28 AM Something I\'m thinking is that the Machine Plague may have originated in a corner of the Outmost, and that the Altikhari/Sentinel One wormhole (I\'m starting off with two at first - that one, and the Novayan wormhole) drops you off out there. There\'s a zone of the Outmost where only spacebornes, bio/biomechanoid civilizations, and civilizations with advanced AI, managed to move world to world, because the distances involved were distances that discouraged exploration by Earthlike cultures. There\'s probably some weird "Ancients" out there, too. (As opposed to the Inmost, which is younger civilization after younger civilization built over the ashes of the previous, and spacefaring even being enabled by individuals with strong ambition and individual families, provided they can get the labor to build their ships) Btw Earth is juuuuuuust at the very edge of the Outmost, and AI played a huge role in the scaling of the AWC. (edited) logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 02/20/2022 5:50 PM r\'ketha - face tats indicating membership in a fictive kin Novayan family group. It\'s passed from one person possessing it to another person, is seen as some type of magic charm by Novayans, and new ones can only be given by a Seer. There are human spacers who are part of r\'ketha lineages, and some r\'ketha which passed through two or three humans before circling back to a Novayan. aliens D — 02/22/2022 7:33 PM @Vyrient I\'m kinda inspired by Tarot of the Cat People for what a Novayan wedding must be like D — 02/22/2022 7:38 PM I think it\'s specifically a Wanderer tradition, between two people Wandering together, and has nothing to do with Novayan family law. It involves bringing the new Wanderer into one\'s Wanderer lodge though, which is kind of a weird fictive kin thing (that includes some actual kin as well) implying shared responsibility with other members of the initiated group. Plenty of lodges are actually mixed species and some broke apart from their Novayan roots entirely, and there are a couple of small syndicates that began as lodges. D — 02/24/2022 7:23 AM I am just totally going with the Novayans being sexually objectified cat people now. It\'s just more leaning toward Rule 63 of that. D — 02/24/2022 7:43 AM There\'s a thing with Novayan male and female sexuality that I\'m thinking about. The females provide the stability and safety. The most aspirational male role is Champion to a clan, where they basically get to knock up the sisters. But he often gets dueled out of it. (And if it\'s a wild clan - he may just outright get killed.) D — 02/24/2022 7:43 AM And yes I increasingly believe that "civilized" Novayans have this outright code duello thing and there is a lot of discourse around "are you man or beast. If you are man then fight like one." D — 02/24/2022 7:46 AM But... Novayan males in a bonded pair, often live a lot longer. D — 02/24/2022 7:52 AM Now the funny thing that\'s come up in my writing is that what Novayans consider feminine, isn\'t even on the map with what we think that means. D — 02/24/2022 8:01 AM An intact male who performs the right kind of Novayan masculinity, is signaling to other Novayans that he knows the rules of society, and won\'t give in to the Beast. (edited) D — 03/13/2022 10:18 PM Novayans in space tend to slam back a lot of caffeine human-culture-stuff D — 03/24/2022 9:02 PM One of the things that figured into Co-Mod design early had to do with Novayans having more sensitive hearing and sense of smell, and also being an absolute bedrock part of the early Co-Op and the Watch, and the Watch having significant interplay with the Co-Op. D — 03/24/2022 9:02 PM On the other hand, anything designed specifically for Novayans, would be hard for humans to use, because it\'s designed for an ambidextrous species that can latch onto something with its tail in microgravity. D — 03/29/2022 10:31 AM Also going to point out that Val isn\'t the only spacer with Novayan tribal style tats, there are plenty of humans who\'ve gotten inked by Novayans, or who\'ve even passed on Novayan legacy/quest tats through human after human. D — 03/29/2022 10:48 AM @Caffeine Delusions it\'s going to be interesting when future generations of Nadiran or even half-Nadiran half-human identify hugely with spacer culture, and some have Novayan tats... language-and-sundry D — 04/08/2022 7:23 PM Part of me wants to use Dame as an honorific (what it translates most closely to, anyway) for the head of a Novayan family. news-and-real-life-inspo-for-both-spacers-and-surge-city D — 04/09/2022 9:43 PM Novayan rations tend to be in shelf stable foil packs like cat food. D — 04/30/2022 11:23 AM I’m hugely going here with some of the species. Xirin are low gravity fliers, Nadiran are adapted to micro-g like various takes on Belters and quite frail but also tall, we see various physical problems in older generations of Co-Op spacers that the tech got better at dealing with, and Novayans (just for fun) actually gain a slight edge. Intact males can lose a certain amount of bone and muscle mass before it becomes a problem, but also, their vestibular systems and ambidexterity and the (stabilizing but not load bearing) prehensile tails give them advantages. (edited) Jump the-inmost D — 05/02/2022 8:09 AM AAHHH DUDE WITH THE HOODED ROBE AND GOGGLES. I have a priest figure that looks like that. I\'m going to be sitting and mapping out Kybaria and its factions given I\'m about to drag Val through. We\'ll have some other worlds later. Kybaria is the first inhabited world you come across on the other side of the Novayan Wormhole though. (edited) the-outmost D — 05/05/2022 4:55 PM The Outmost. Not long after the discovery of the Novayan Wormhole, the same findings led to definitive proof of the existence of a wormhole within spitting distance of the Perimeter on the other side. This joins Co-Op space to a region right on the edge of the All Worlds Coalition\'s territory, a region once also heavily patrolled by the Proxima Corporation during the 22nd century, before its by and large downfall and the forming of the Co-Op. This is at the very edge of the Outmost. The very edge. Deeper in - further out, that is - worlds are further apart, and the sky is darker. As I\'ve discussed the dynamic in the Inmost (a bit further coreward down the Orion Arm from the Perimeter, aka Co-Op Space): the reverse is true here. Many species simply did not even get offworld, because the effort involved in leaving your system for the next one... made it nigh unto impossible. (edited) aliens D — 05/07/2022 11:15 PM Exploration of Novayan traditions around love, their biology and how it affects their emotions and reactions (wired for the hunt, the personal mastery of the Beast), going Wanderer and the humans and others who also go Wanderer D — 05/07/2022 11:15 PM (Val\'s quest mark on her face declares her status as Wanderer to Novayans) D — 05/07/2022 11:21 PM Novayans have the hat of being the most sexually objectified aliens lol the-inmost D — 05/23/2022 10:54 AM Basically the thing with the Inmost for anyone who hasn\'t been in the loop this whole time is that it\'s a region of space quite a bit coreward of Co-Op space, that the Novayan Wormhole and possibly some others shortcut to, where worlds are fairly tightly packed. You can\'t spin up an Alcubierre drive (A-Drive) in that space at all, because of all the gravity wells, because systems aren\'t even very far apart. But the situation there evolved from the fact that it doesn\'t exactly take Star Trek levels of tech to become an overlord wielding absolute holy hell over multiple worlds. Various cultures there have gotten to about a 20th century level of propulsion technology over, over, over again in the distant past, and nuked themselves and each other back into the stone age... over and over. D — 05/23/2022 10:57 AM The discovery of the Novayan Wormhole (in the story I\'m writing with Val) and Val\'s stranding on/return from a world just on the other side, are the first seen of this by anyone in the Co-Op, but by the time the game is set in, there\'s a Co-Op base on either side of it (Novaya Waypoint One, managed by ItSyn; on the other side - Novaya Waypoint Two, managed by DSES). co-op-specific D — 05/25/2022 10:11 AM CoStanSyn is a more multispecies org that traditionally had some heavy Novayan input, while the Library will always contend with slight human bias. Non-Humans very very much have a vested interest in participating in CoStanSyn. language-and-sundry D — 05/25/2022 11:02 AM I think there may be some of this with Novayans. They don\'t really need anything except for their strength and stamina, and their claws and teeth. logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 05/27/2022 1:28 PM Okay tell me what two little bits of candy these are. One\'s coming from another awkward gifted teenager at Pre, and the other from a fellow trainee on an MCT (a Novayan who moved on to another post instead of staying on). I’d had some friends in Pre, and as a trainee – what little “candy” I had on my jacket, connected to that. The pin that Harlow in Pre had given me because I’d helped him with his Co-Mod project, and also, I think he had a crush on me. But it’s not like I could ever pry that admission out of him, anyway, and it’s just as well because I might have had to have had some kind of answer for it. And he didn’t post to ItSyn with me, but disappeared to one of the Communes. Then there was K\'Thanni, who posted to the MCT with me, and helped me pass my Novayan language ratings. She left at the end of the Trainee period and went off to fly on a Novayan merchanter. aliens D — 05/28/2022 7:25 PM Courting your ladylove by singing (or in this case, giving them a tape of your singing, possibly including a song you wrote for her) seems like something a Novayan would do, right? If the teacup-Novayans outside, going MROOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW at night, are any indication. (edited) RF, Stacker of the Dead — 05/28/2022 7:41 PM Novayan mariachi? D — 05/29/2022 9:49 PM Val\'s tape of R\'Kesh\'s singing is going to come into play later in her story, I\'m thinking that his giving her something like that would mean something coming from a Novayan. D — 05/29/2022 10:12 PM Etiquette is something about which Novayans care very much. D — 05/30/2022 8:29 PM Ok, so this might help me write this. How do Novayans carry out a romance. I think males court, but females will usually reject most males who court, and drive them off. That\'s a factor in Novayan male psychology around courting, if they had to be assured of an absolute "yes" to ever approach, or that it would be low risk... that Novayan isn\'t getting any. (edited) D — 05/30/2022 8:29 PM That said, that\'s with other Novayans. D — 05/30/2022 8:32 PM A thing the males like about mating offworld is it\'s, well, safer... less competition. Being in an actual bonded pair offworld, gives you a chance of living longer. An intact male Novayan has better chances as a Wanderer, guided by the wisdom of the Stars Themselves, than he does onworld. A major species drive is to find new territory. D — 05/30/2022 8:34 PM Another thing is that intact male Novayans, especially around females in season, are such testosterone beasts that basically the testosterone loss from extended microgravity work (and less likelihood of encountering a female in season) just... chills them out a bit. Like, it just takes the edge off... (edited) D — 05/30/2022 8:39 PM Anyway, thinking about how it would\'ve gone with a Novayan female that R\'Kesh met Wandering - who he\'d probably have gone to find some territory with, and started a family, and then eventually gotten fixed and become the patriarch/mentor over her future litters. That will probably help me brainstorm how this goes, given he and Val basically intend to just Wander forever. He may be a unique soul, a dreamer who had to leave to continue his work, and it may be because he didn\'t do the traditional thing - a traditional Novayan partnership - that the work even got passed on to someone who completed it. D — 06/01/2022 4:48 PM So when Novayans refer to "the Stars," "the Stars Themselves," or refer to something or another as "their Star" - especially Novayan males, or females who have gone Wanderer - there is a special thing about this. The stars aren\'t just celestial bodies, they\'re the blueprint of a Wanderer\'s life, and their spiritual guide. D — 06/01/2022 4:51 PM but if a Novayan calls you his "shining star" it\'s more than romantic, he\'s saying that you guide him through life and give him purpose. D — 06/02/2022 2:49 PM The thing with R\'Kesh makes me kind of sad. His work ultimately opened the Ways. It took a female taking on his work after he pointlessly died in a bar stabbing to get it taken seriously. Otherwise, Novayans just saw him as a waste of perfectly good genes. He\'s also considered an exceptionally handsome male. D — 06/02/2022 2:51 PM The setting also has a lot to say about male Novayans and bodily autonomy in their matriarchal culture. D — 06/02/2022 2:53 PM Think of a Novayan beauty pageant winner if they had to defend their title in a duel every year, get sterilized, or become an exile. And recognized early as prime beefcake and groomed into the role. This gives context to Wanderer and why R\'Kesh saw Val as one too. D — 06/02/2022 2:56 PM A Novayan with no clan or inheritance, who makes their way outside the family stead. Jump D — 06/02/2022 3:04 PM Most (not all) Novayans working independently or for the Co-Op are male. The ones who have clanships, or work for the Watch (often on all-Novayan ships), are female. D — 06/02/2022 3:05 PM Wanderers have a separate spirituality from clan Novayans D — 06/02/2022 3:10 PM Ooh I\'m gonna play with this. The Novayans laid megaliths in alignment of the Starry Path, in the spaces that they settle. co-op-specific D — 06/03/2022 10:08 AM The Novayan wormhole, which significantly altered the trade and economic calculus (especially down the road - the beginning of the Co-Op syndicates being part of luxury goods and exotic matter trade, possibly expanding into a very Wild West-y frontier of space, and other stuff). Also who knows how many more wormholes there actually are. aliens D — 06/11/2022 12:38 AM I gotta think on Novayans and the Life Quest, at least in the case of R\'Kesh. He left behind what would\'ve been a secure, even high status, comfortable life and became Wanderer, and I\'m feeling a Seer would\'ve endorsed this and marked him, and... what was this based on, a dream? D — 06/11/2022 10:59 AM This is great shit. It\'s going in the Novayans species entry. D — 06/11/2022 11:05 AM He had taken on the life quest of finding the fabled route by which the Novayans had settled Novaya, this is actually the life quest Val took up (because you can take on another\'s quest when they die), haven\'t decided if this was his Dream or not. D — 06/11/2022 11:05 AM But it was one likely shared by a line of previous Novayans too. D — 06/11/2022 12:14 PM The irony being - this may be how Novayans traveled the stars, just generation after generation producing Wanderers, moving further and further out, even starting families on new worlds. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/11/2022 12:31 PM Were the Novayans always so heavily matriarchal? the-inmost D — 06/12/2022 11:03 AM (Then I end up with another question. It\'s a Novayan ship that brought Val and the scout craft to the edge of the wormhole. Did they all go through? Did the ship end up shot down and Val, who was in Alvin [small one person craft], ended up sole survivor? Or did she just take Alvin through the wormhole alone?) (edited) aliens D — 06/13/2022 9:42 AM A reason struck me that Novayans would seem like they perfume themselves, that isn\'t specific to intact males masking their scent. ...the grooming rituals are social, sure, but also it\'s about repelling parasites Message could not be loaded. D — 06/13/2022 9:50 AM imagining Novayan ecosystem is going to be interesting, to make sure I don\'t just make it a copy of Earth\'s. D — 06/13/2022 9:51 AM OK, this will be a funny image: Novayans after a shower, shaking their fur out, then suddenly having it fluff up. D — 06/13/2022 9:54 AM A ship outfitted for multispecies crew that includes Novayans, probably has climbing walls in the rec room. Also they\'re incredibly good at parkour relative to humans and can basically drop on you from out of a tree. (edited) D — 06/13/2022 9:59 AM I\'ve thought a bit of temperamental differences between males and females, and gendered stereotypes (as well as which males and females break them). One thing that comes up for me via the relationship between R\'Kesh and Val is that he saw this woman who parses as heavily butch by conventional, contemporary (as in, today) standards, as feminine by Novayan standards. And many Novayans would see conventional dolled-up human women as being like lazy men by comparison (assuming the human in question isn\'t a fighter/athletic/a physical worker). (edited) D — 06/13/2022 10:00 AM Novayan males are expected to go through about four times as many beauty and social rituals as the females. D — 06/13/2022 10:06 AM Braided manes, eye makeup to accentuate the eyes, basically showing that they are well groomed (to a performative and ornamental level that isn\'t expected of females or near as much of cut-ears, and partly because of masking the intact male scent) is a proxy for safety to some degree because a male Novayan who doesn\'t do these things at the right social times, may actually be mentally unstable/sick which is treated as potentially dangerous. D — 06/13/2022 10:12 AM Novayan males on Novaya, in the clans, spend a lot of time negotiating subtle social displays and stuff intended to avoid a violent confrontation with other Novayans (which doesn\'t always work). Females are actually the ones more focused on hunting, but usually live in family groups with other females. Also I can imagine the females being kind of sexually crude with each other sometimes. "Check out the pouch on that one." then the same male making his way through the group gets his ass patted multiple times. D — 06/13/2022 10:15 AM Btw, space work for non-Novayan companies gives males the chance to work in space that they don\'t normally get on Novayan ships. D — 06/13/2022 10:16 AM Given I can imagine all-Novayan crews being all female, usually related. D — 06/13/2022 10:16 AM Though I\'m going to let myself develop the rest of the Novayan culture much more before I go there because I feel it\'s a specific convention to CJ Cherryh\'s Chanur books, rather than "cat people trope." Thing is though is that given cats, it\'s logical to me. D — 06/13/2022 10:23 AM There are a lot of perks to being cut-ear, it\'s aspirational to enough Novayans. And modern female Novayans get fixed, too, in modern facilities, especially if they\'ve already borne litters. Or get shots to suppress estrus offworld. It makes it easier, socially. Given the social disruption among males that can be caused by a female in heat. There are huge taboos and whatnot related to to times of year, to enforce separation between the village life and males who aren\'t specifically chosen to be part of it during that time (which is where a ton of the warrior training comes in; warrior training among Novayans isn\'t just about being a killer, because they\'re born killers. It\'s about self control too.) D — 06/13/2022 10:25 AM Novayan male partnership usually looks like the male becoming the stud (or Champion) and either remaining in the clan over time and going Cut-Ear, or continuing to defend that title year after year (be interesting if that isn\'t just some random tomcat fight, but is an actual organized Games of some kind.) D — 06/02/2022 2:56 PM A Novayan with no clan or inheritance, who makes their way outside the family stead. Jump D — 06/02/2022 3:04 PM Most (not all) Novayans working independently or for the Co-Op are male. The ones who have clanships, or work for the Watch (often on all-Novayan ships), are female. D — 06/02/2022 3:05 PM Wanderers have a separate spirituality from clan Novayans D — 06/02/2022 3:10 PM Ooh I\'m gonna play with this. The Novayans laid megaliths in alignment of the Starry Path, in the spaces that they settle. co-op-specific D — 06/03/2022 10:08 AM The Novayan wormhole, which significantly altered the trade and economic calculus (especially down the road - the beginning of the Co-Op syndicates being part of luxury goods and exotic matter trade, possibly expanding into a very Wild West-y frontier of space, and other stuff). Also who knows how many more wormholes there actually are. aliens D — 06/11/2022 12:38 AM I gotta think on Novayans and the Life Quest, at least in the case of R\'Kesh. He left behind what would\'ve been a secure, even high status, comfortable life and became Wanderer, and I\'m feeling a Seer would\'ve endorsed this and marked him, and... what was this based on, a dream? D — 06/11/2022 10:59 AM This is great shit. It\'s going in the Novayans species entry. D — 06/11/2022 11:05 AM He had taken on the life quest of finding the fabled route by which the Novayans had settled Novaya, this is actually the life quest Val took up (because you can take on another\'s quest when they die), haven\'t decided if this was his Dream or not. D — 06/11/2022 11:05 AM But it was one likely shared by a line of previous Novayans too. D — 06/11/2022 12:14 PM The irony being - this may be how Novayans traveled the stars, just generation after generation producing Wanderers, moving further and further out, even starting families on new worlds. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/11/2022 12:31 PM Were the Novayans always so heavily matriarchal? the-inmost D — 06/12/2022 11:03 AM (Then I end up with another question. It\'s a Novayan ship that brought Val and the scout craft to the edge of the wormhole. Did they all go through? Did the ship end up shot down and Val, who was in Alvin [small one person craft], ended up sole survivor? Or did she just take Alvin through the wormhole alone?) (edited) aliens D — 06/13/2022 9:42 AM A reason struck me that Novayans would seem like they perfume themselves, that isn\'t specific to intact males masking their scent. ...the grooming rituals are social, sure, but also it\'s about repelling parasites Message could not be loaded. D — 06/13/2022 9:50 AM imagining Novayan ecosystem is going to be interesting, to make sure I don\'t just make it a copy of Earth\'s. D — 06/13/2022 9:51 AM OK, this will be a funny image: Novayans after a shower, shaking their fur out, then suddenly having it fluff up. D — 06/13/2022 9:54 AM A ship outfitted for multispecies crew that includes Novayans, probably has climbing walls in the rec room. Also they\'re incredibly good at parkour relative to humans and can basically drop on you from out of a tree. (edited) D — 06/13/2022 9:59 AM I\'ve thought a bit of temperamental differences between males and females, and gendered stereotypes (as well as which males and females break them). One thing that comes up for me via the relationship between R\'Kesh and Val is that he saw this woman who parses as heavily butch by conventional, contemporary (as in, today) standards, as feminine by Novayan standards. And many Novayans would see conventional dolled-up human women as being like lazy men by comparison (assuming the human in question isn\'t a fighter/athletic/a physical worker).

D — 06/13/2022 10:32 AM I wouldn\'t be surprised if Novayan life has all kinds of unwritten rules. It\'s interesting seeing Val integrate so well with them, but... Novayan unwritten rules are inherently pragmatic. Jump D — 06/13/2022 3:18 PM Novayan viewpoints around sickness, disability, mental health are going to be interesting and some viewpoints will be foreign to humans. D — 06/13/2022 3:20 PM Sickness and mental health: because Novayans are actually afraid of the Beast emerging, and that\'s seen as a threat to the community, and also they may be practicing a kind of quarantine against infectious disease, I suspect there\'s a cultural thing of Novayans basically being just expected to go tough it out by themselves. But especially if they\'re male, because compromised males are seen as threatening. (edited) D — 06/13/2022 3:23 PM Physical disability: they\'re okay with you missing a limb or an eye especially if there\'s a story behind it (and if it\'s a boring story, you should make up a better one.) But you\'re possibly going to get a nickname regarding it. Blind Novayans can still get around relatively effectively within a clan/village life though if born that way, they may be expected to go cut-ear at puberty... but that\'s along with 75% of the males anyway. If there\'s a deaf Novayan character in here somewhere, I\'m going to make them all white, with blue eyes. (edited) D — 06/13/2022 3:26 PM Mental illness: it depends. You don\'t want to display any tendency to let the Beast take over if you want other Novayans to let you live, or not exile you forever. D — 06/13/2022 3:33 PM There are probably Wanderer Novayans, especially spacers, with cyberlimbs. Traditionalist Novayans living in villages/clansteads might feel weird about it. D — 06/13/2022 5:28 PM some more stuff about stereotypes... females: practical, tactical, strategic, the better hunters, hunt in groups, if a female Novayan wanted you dead then you\'re dead already. Message could not be loaded. D — 06/13/2022 5:36 PM I should make the deaf, white Novayan a Seer. They may have superstitions about albinos, and the "blind seer" trope doesn\'t really hold with a species that places much importance on their hearing, and blind people can get around largely with their hearing, tail, whiskers, proprioception (the latter of which in a Novayan is superior to a human\'s) (edited) D — 06/13/2022 6:50 PM Given I\'m writing this burgeoning romance between a Wanderer and his human love, with whom he ends up a bonded pair, i get to ask, what is this like for a Novayan. (edited) Message could not be loaded. Kirikizande — 06/13/2022 6:53 PM I love this idea and would appreciate it if the Novayan was also cute and fluffy D — 06/14/2022 9:46 AM When I read story portions to L and my MIL, I always give the Novayans a sexy accent. D — 06/15/2022 10:59 AM \\* a blue eyed, white Novayan who\'s deaf. (the Seer) D — 06/15/2022 11:09 AM Also something in Novayan psychology - is that tendency toward the Frenzy absolutely would be something on a character sheet because it\'s not the same from Novayan to Novayan. Warrior training actually seeks to control that, to be able to meet foes without going beast mode. Someone with that training would also have some boost to their impulse control, and impulse control is a big thing for Novayans. (They are ADHD: the Species.) D — 06/15/2022 11:10 AM On to Novayan senses. D — 06/15/2022 11:15 AM [1] Ah shit, maybe this is when she gets her tattoo. The thing with the tattoo is that it\'s going to mark her forever as someone connected intimately to the Novayan culture, but specifically Wanderer traditions. And @RF, Stacker of the Dead, here\'s what you mentioned, humans that basically live out on the frontier that have no place among Core Worlds humans, and have been somewhat taken in by Novayans. Boom. Val is that now (the story I\'m writing is "how did this happen.") [2] the stars aren\'t owned by Novayans; this isn\'t "I claim this for Novaya." They\'re used as references for individuals, which are treated as navigational guides for those that come after. (edited) D — 06/15/2022 11:20 AM Ok, back to Novayan senses. D — 06/15/2022 11:21 AM When R\'Kesh (in story) makes the observation that Val has what Novayans refer to in some humans as "cat senses" (except for cat proprioception lol) that made me think, I have to think about what Novayan senses even ARE, from the point of view of a Novayan. (edited) D — 06/15/2022 11:23 AM Two parts to this, Novayan body (and its orientation to its environment) and Novayan senses/nervous system. (edited) D — 06/15/2022 11:27 AM Body considerations: Can leap greater distances, excellent sprinters (but will tire out), and can move quietly (if naked; implication is of a Novayan taking off their clothes and whatever footwear when deciding to give chase or to stalk) RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/15/2022 11:52 AM Also had implications for technology. Color coding is implicit in human design, we use colors for designations all the time. Like for electrical wiring, color designates what each individual wire does. Sometimes two tone for complex setups. Novayan inclusive design will have patters as well as color. D — 06/15/2022 11:53 AM That might even be a broad Co-Mod thing because Novayans were part and parcel of the early formation of CoStanSyn. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/15/2022 1:16 PM >numerous complaints about missing underwear and phys Ed gear from male students in Pre class >selection of missing garments seems to single out the students that are more liberal with personal hygiene >Thievery levels grow beyond minor nuisance, making it AN ISSUE for the docents >Subsequent classwide surprise locker inspection called for >Mortified female Novayan stands watching as an avalanche of smelly underwear comes tumbling out of her locker D — 06/15/2022 7:04 PM Nah, a deaf Novayan wouldn\'t be a seer. D — 06/15/2022 7:06 PM Novayans\' hearing is too culturally central. It\'s superior to humans\' (how much?). A good question would be how Novayans feel in human-specific made environments, and at parties, etc. I suspect too that when they vacation, they like to be outdoors. D — 06/15/2022 7:08 PM One of the things with cultural centrality of hearing, is that their loresongs are deeply important to them, and Novayans\' first academic pedagogy is in loresong. D — 06/15/2022 7:11 PM There\'s probably plenty of Novayan music that uses rhythmic elements (drumming) Jump D — 06/15/2022 7:29 PM I am looking at this from a very Novayan-centric point of view that\'s probably going to be some conversation between Val and R\'Kesh sitting in the hold some late night. D — 06/15/2022 10:57 PM Know what? I don\'t think many Novayans really like noisy enclosed crowded spaces. D — 06/15/2022 10:58 PM I think they\'ll do it to get laid, plenty will dance on a table, but enough humans want to bang a Novayan that it\'s not like they have to stay at the party that long. D — 06/15/2022 10:59 PM Their ideal idea of leisure may involve being downworld and running through the woods. Be funny if some group from the ship were camping and the Novayan of the party was enjoying spending the night in a tree. D — 06/15/2022 11:02 PM One thing\'s for sure, something perks a Novayan\'s ears or whiskers... they\'re often down the hall checking it out, before they even know what it is. D — 06/15/2022 11:02 PM It probably would take a roll to some kind of self-control/impulse control stat for a Novayan to even resist that. D — 06/16/2022 12:01 AM Novayans would have an advantage with initiative. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/16/2022 8:29 AM What does a Novayan with the zoomies look like? D — 06/16/2022 9:06 AM One thing is that because Novayans can jump and climb really well, and also balance walking on narrow ledges, they\'ll also be able to go to spaces on the game map that the humans won\'t find as accessible. D — 06/16/2022 10:12 AM Novayans also get actually lost less. Ok. This is all upsides. What are downsides to being Novayan? Message could not be loaded. D — 06/16/2022 10:42 AM Novayans already spend tremendous time in grooming too Message could not be loaded. D — 06/16/2022 10:47 AM I\'ve already imagined something like this by implying that Novayan Wanderers get tattoos. D — 06/16/2022 10:49 AM I\'ve thought that the fur is trimmed close rather than completely shorn, I think Novayans would be extremely uncomfortable without some fur there. But that the tattoo technique causes fur not to regrow over the mark. D — 06/16/2022 11:00 AM R\'Kesh as navigator probably swapped out some different interfaces when he came on shift. You would not be able to do this in a SafMod-compliant ship quite the same way, if at all. Also what jobs Novayans tend to have on a ship, will probably affect how much space walk stuff they do. I\'m comfortable saying they are probably more likely to do some jobs than others. Also being a navigator has some traditional aspirationalism to it, culturally speaking. D — 06/16/2022 11:00 AM Novayans have something resembling hands, but I\'m willing to say they\'re not as dextrous with fine-motor stuff as we are. D — 06/16/2022 11:02 AM I am really amusing myself with imagining Novayans chasing robots in designated parts of the ship or station, during their offtime. D — 06/16/2022 11:08 AM Probably most Novayans in practice are omnisexual. RF, Stacker of the Dead — 06/16/2022 11:26 AM The way their RBCs, musculoskeletal system and temperature regulation all work together, they\'re ambush or stalk and ambush hunters. They can\'t get enough oxygen to their muscles fast enough or shed heat, so they lack the stamina of a persistence hunter. Like if a human and Novayan arm wrestled, the Novayan would have an explosive start with their better muscle twitch speeds, but if a human could weather that, they\'d find the Novayan quickly weakening and push through to win. D — 06/16/2022 11:27 AM And the Novayan would have to spend time sleeping it off. D — 06/17/2022 8:01 PM Next about Novayans: we\'ve figured that Novayans send all kinds of Novayans out into exile. Some will become Wanderers, who are guided by their particular dream vision or are tied to a Life Quest, some will just live in the wild and go feral. R\'Kesh was guided by a vision of his ancestors who came through the Wormhole, and it\'s something that may lurk deep in Novayan epigenetics, given that Novayans are many descended from a few. D — 06/17/2022 8:02 PM A good thing to think on though is what all could a person be sent into exile for. Also, what constitutes a mentally ill Novayan. D — 06/17/2022 8:09 PM Despite Novayan neurotypical resembling human ADHD, they probably accommodate a fairly broad range of personalities, given the organization of their culture. Be interesting if many of them aren\'t strong readers. Most of them are fairly good with numbers and very very good with spatial stuff. They always know where they are, when dirtside. Navigation, communications related work, and security related work tend to be popular choices. Navigation is an ancient Novayan trade with its own loresongs and Wanderer lineages connected to it. They would be good at being whatever equivalents of a Ranger that this setting has. Mmm possibly pilot? In human-made environments: Novayans\' sharp senses make them perpetually aware of their environment on some level, though some tune it out by daydreaming. When their perpetually scanning senses lock onto something - like prey - they\'re all in, stay out of the way. The hyperfocus states come from ancestral prey drive, and will probably be a game mechanic. Novayans\' sharp senses and inclination to perpetually be scanning their environment for something to attend to, will often cause an individual Novayan to be in a fairly perpetual state of agitation if they\'re in a boring environment; they will actually take a hit to impulse control, and the player would have to buy it off, though energy drinks etc will give a temporary boost to that. Novayan early child development is sufficiently different from humans\' that a Novayan educated like a human in early childhood, will be a damaged Novayan, possibly one that other Novayans would put down at some point. (edited) D — 06/17/2022 8:13 PM Novayans are quick on their feet from a dead sleep. D — 06/17/2022 10:18 PM Makes sense. The only thing with being cut-ear is that it\'s a really commonplace Novayan surgery... maybe it\'s entering a new phase of life more than "giving something up." D — 06/18/2022 3:21 PM I was thinking on Val\'s early life and what it was like with other humans and how she found a life in mixed species spaces, and basically adopted by Novayans, and something came up about Novayans. Jump D — 06/18/2022 3:22 PM The way that Novayans are raised, there are certain things that little human kids do with each other that Novayans get beat out of them young. D — 06/18/2022 3:22 PM Novayan young are kittens. D — 06/18/2022 3:32 PM granted if she put a fist in the kid\'s face for it, I think that the Novayan teacher would\'ve said "he will never do that again will he?" (edited) D — 06/18/2022 3:32 PM the thing is, Novayan kittens give each other shit D — 06/18/2022 3:34 PM but in any case, I think that Novayans have certain etiquette around their interactions with each other, that are taught young, and by some degree of trial and error, though the adults would intervene sometimes if it got to be too much. D — 06/18/2022 4:59 PM Novayans don\'t even begin their formal 3 r\'s academic training until relatively later in their childhood than humans D — 06/18/2022 5:00 PM You don\'t get sent to the academic environment until you\'ve become a socially adapted Novayan. The costs of not being, are often brutal. D — 06/18/2022 5:02 PM I think that basically kits are allowed to be free range in the center of town, with the adult females and cut-ears doing their own thing, often forming a circular perimeter around that for much of the day. Many will be napping, but a Novayan can arouse to full wakefulness quickly and snap to their feet (this is going to be a game mechanic) D — 06/18/2022 9:45 PM They tend to be sought for casual partners by humans, and they\'re often happy to, it lacks the drama and potential violent conflicts of Novayan intimacy. D — 06/18/2022 9:55 PM Novayans are occasionally tragic lovers, though. But they\'ll be loyal to a pair bond in the wild, or Wandering, it buys them more life expectancy. D — 06/21/2022 9:24 PM Myrmidon aesthetics... to distinguish them from the Nadiran and Novayans, both of whom are very well defined at this point aesthetically... D — 06/21/2022 9:26 PM I\'m going to say they have an appreciation of color and also love flowers and sweets. None of which are really Novayan or Nadiran things. D — 06/21/2022 9:27 PM What\'s more is they have intense color vision and can see many different shades of color that will look like maybe just a few shades to a human, fewer to a Novayan or Nadiran D — 06/21/2022 10:06 PM They\'re probably much smaller when they\'re born, and helpless at first (Novayan early rearing is actually most successful with groups of sisters sharing the burdens) but quickly grow to the size of housecats, then human infants (edited) D — 06/21/2022 10:07 PM Novayan children are active D — 06/21/2022 10:08 PM Novayans prefer to raise their children downworld, unlike humans who are fine bringing up families on ships and space stations D — 06/21/2022 10:09 PM Much of Novayan village life is still very rural and they prefer to raise their children with the freedom to run and the ability to join in the hunt with their parents D — 06/23/2022 1:38 PM Sometimes I keep hitting notes with the Novayans that make me wonder if I should read some of those books though there are probably only so many ways you can write cats to begin with, they will always be, fundamentally... cats. D — 06/24/2022 1:17 PM Energy drinks are marketed to Novayans with different imagery than they would be to humans D — 06/24/2022 1:17 PM ...a Novayan sitting on a meditation cushion D — 06/27/2022 10:17 PM Ok, Novayans: D — 06/28/2022 9:00 AM Myrmidons\' relationship to humanity is very different from Novayans\'. Novayans were part of the founding of the Co-Op as equals, and though they\'ve had exploitative relationships with non-Novayans, they\'ve never really been colonized, so they see their relationship with humans in the Co-Op as more equal. They don\'t NEED us, either. D ��� 07/03/2022 11:18 PM The rituals of mourning that ensure the dead person\'s work will continue, the Novayan traditions that keep Novayans connected, often across generations or more, as some remain on the ground and some go off - especially considering that Novayans who become Light Chasers (a spacing lifestyle that Novayan spacer traditions are uniquely adapted to) may never see a living soul of their own generation before returning home, should they stay gone long enough. D — 07/03/2022 11:22 PM When the Orphans came to the Perimeter, moving into the spacing industry as a diasporic population weaving together many shattered cultures, it was the rituals that already formed the fabric of Novayan life - as Novayans had been working the lanes for much longer - that formed the backbone of what evolved, and there is a strong early Novayan input into the symbol systems of CoStandard. I see a few minor changes to make but there you go, boom, there’s a Novayan. Jump D — 07/06/2022 4:02 PM how upright are Novayans compared to humans, is a good question. D — 07/06/2022 5:40 PM They seem to place cultural importance on acting less feral beast, using blades instead of your teeth or claws, observing etiquette around mating and territory, etc. and basically consider it not to be murder if you slay a Novayan who is frenzied. This value system may inform how far along the quadruped vs biped continuum we are talking. And they may associate being on all fours as being beastly. D — 07/10/2022 2:32 PM That may be old and may be a slang that came to Orphans/spacers via Novayans D — 07/11/2022 10:09 AM Thinking on the Novayan tattoo technique. Fur isn\'t going to grow back where it\'s applied. Researching this a little and I\'m thinking something like ink rubbing: D — 07/11/2022 10:14 AM Meaning that at one point early in Co-Op history, there were probably almost as many humans with Novayan tattoos, as Novayans. The tattoos indicate, at a glance, a couple of things... one being an adoptive kin relationship (the chin tattoo that Val has, which is identical to K\'Ratha\'s and R\'Kesh\'s) across time and space which not only identifies you to another person you know but it also identifies you as a member of that kin-group to their descendants (fictive in the case of Wanderers, more than literal). D — 07/11/2022 10:16 AM Wouldn\'t be surprised if there are other images that are lucky/protective, such as, something representing a guiding Star, probably some travelers\' protective wards that have very very very old roots pre-dating the Novayans being spacers. (edited) D — 07/11/2022 10:18 AM Writing, depends. There are some things that may NOT be written. And it\'s such a taboo that a Novayan seeing that writing on another Novayan will think "what other rules does this one break." (With Novayans being VERY itchy about any signs that a Novayan could potentially hulk out, or violate their rules about boundaries/thresholds. Which are more important onworld than off.) (edited) human-culture-stuff D — 07/15/2022 10:39 PM Makes sense. You will start getting some high end microculture products and a new variety of things with the addition of the (vegan) Krayahan Nadiran to the Perimeter community. Novayans live largely off of fish in space, and probably supplements, but on their own world, they eat wild game. They don\'t require great variety. aliens D — 07/17/2022 6:23 PM Ok, R\' and K\' as prefixes are specific to Wanderers. This specific Novayan flies with the Watch, probably with some family members, that\'s different. Wanderers tend to go independent or fly with the Co-Op. D — 07/17/2022 6:24 PM Also are more often male. Whereas this specific Novayan (a female) probably actually has a family name that references territory and matrilineal family line. (edited) D — 07/17/2022 6:30 PM also, meet Karrath tha le Shenarr resh ta Khairas, or just Karrath. Captain Karrath, of the Watch. Think of the Martian warships on "The Expanse," that\'s roughly similar to what she\'s flying, with her daughters Karrath will end up heading up a task force of the Watch, and will be based out of Waypoint One, watching that side of the Waymouth on the edge of the Novayan system. co-op-specific D — 07/18/2022 10:14 AM Ultimately one of the biggest challenges to SafSyn\'s rise in prominence was that Novaya actually had a very sharp uptick in prestige and influence because of the discovery of the wormhole on the edge of their system, and the Novayans and the Watch moved quickly to lock SafSyn out of primacy there. Going to say that SafSyn has a strong regional loyalty too that\'s more specific to the communes, particularly in that corner of the Perimeter. aliens D — 08/03/2022 11:54 AM Novayans may idealize loving pure and chaste from afar, especially if your love will make you do something stupid for other Novayans to have drinking songs about. But the Novayan psychology is very different. They definitely will settle for Mr./Ms. Right Now in the meantime and aren\'t necessarily known for being sexually monogamous. And don\'t really have any kind of amatonormativity built into being a bonded pair with other Novayans; that can be your sibling for all they care. Xirin on the other hand... "oh. While I pined for you for a decade, I built this skyscraper. It is not done yet. You don\'t love me back? I will be the greatest architect the universe has ever seen." language-and-sundry D — 08/11/2022 10:42 PM I expect that CoStandard would have a strong English base with a ton of loan words, from other humans as well as some non-humans. Novayan and Nadiran are the two that contributed the most terminology to spacing. scifi-and-trek-general-bullshit D — 09/15/2022 7:58 AM Looking forward to the scene, maybe a couple of years later, where the Novayans basically hold some giant festival and send old school lightsail ships through and I want to map it to Jamestown S\'Klallam\'s yearly canoe gathering. co-op-specific D — 10/10/2022 10:54 AM CoStans are worried that the Safeties themselves are a threat to the cohesion of the Co-Op, will drive the Perimeter toward a long term goal of human-favoring policy, will stifle innovation, STILL won\'t be able to scale successfully, etc. Also, Novayans and Salish and the like won\'t consent to being policed by a force ideologically and politically based in the Communes, which they will see as... colonial. welcome D — 10/22/2022 6:59 PM I liked the bit with being "Star Touched" for Novayans that you fleshed out a bit, and going Wanderer, and I\'m keeping that. aliens D — 11/23/2022 5:52 PM Apropos of Novayans: D — 11/23/2022 5:53 PM But in any case, this is coming up quite a bit with Novayans. co-op-specific D — 12/02/2022 11:44 PM Yeeeeeah. ItSyn is very WWII/Postwar in optic, and kinda Eastern Bloc, that\'s what Val\'s from, but now we\'re entering the new era... the rise of... DSES. DSES has a completely different optic... they\'re a socially, psychologically, and culturally/biologically diverse explorer corps, and... to be Survey, you are not normal. The Co-Op became civilized at its core. Survey are the people pushed to the fringe. On the other side of the wormholes, is the least oversight from the rest of the Co-Op After I flesh out DSES aesthetically with midjourney then I\'ll move on to SafSyn. DSES was a tiny syndicate with fairly little pull at all, written off as basically crackpots, especially by the stodgy ItSyn types, and then - the flight of the Long Way Round. It became the first Co-Op syndicate to receive the full backing of a sovereign world. And that world wasn\'t human - it was the Novayans. D — 12/02/2022 11:47 PM The strong Novayan investment is what keeps them from having to suck up to ItSyn for resources, and keeps them somewhat more aloof of SafSyn. D — 12/04/2022 10:23 AM School environments. These don’t seem like ones Val would do well in, those kind of spaces are sensory hell. I will have to decide what do multispecies CoMod classrooms actually look like. Or perhaps she was just allowed to accommodate. Novayans wear a kind of ear protector in some environments for example. aliens D — 12/04/2022 7:27 PM In the dream, the narrator is with a large feline man named Kesh on a small yellow ship. Kesh sings in his own language as he performs a series of pre-flight checks, using a small leather bag and a braided bracelet to help him focus. The cockpit is silent except for the hum of the engines and Kesh\'s humming over the speaker. The narrator finds comfort in the consistency of the song and the steps it represents. When they arrive at Ansible Relay 44, the narrator steps out of the ship and back on again, finding that Kesh has continued to sing the whole time. Kesh explains that he would only stop singing if he intended to leave the narrator out on the relay. This dream highlights the use of song in Novayan culture as a way to anchor focus and attention. It also suggests that singing is an important part of their daily lives and is used for a variety of purposes. spacers-space-setting D — 12/08/2022 4:22 PM Btw they have weird optics and are argued as colonialist by some factions because they\'re backed by the Novayan crown. Which is an optic a ton of co-oppers really have an issue with. Nevermind that monarchy to the novayans is more like an ambassadorial type of position and possibly elected Jump RF, Stacker of the Dead — 12/08/2022 4:29 PM The Novayans are looking for best return on investment. And I could see the standard DSES response to mumblings as basically being "well, don\'t suck at things so much, then". RF, Stacker of the Dead — 12/08/2022 4:37 PM And Novayans still have heroes. D — Yesterday at 10:00 PM Mainly I wanted to show that her attempts to connect to other people before R\'Kesh just weren\'t working out. She was trying the usual things she\'d been told to do. Hook up in bars. Try the communes. Etc. Jump D — Yesterday at 9:59 PM the commune scene is before she was with R\'Kesh, but it bloated into a whole chapter because she wanted to yak about the various machines and production processes around the farm and seemed more interested in the fact that it was automated than anything else. I\'ve wondered if the bulk of the stuff with Rowantree goes in another book, like, if we circle back to it because DSES-4 has to get involved with something that connects to it. Rowantree is one of the Lower Perimeter settlements, the region that SafSyn arose out of. aliens D — 09/28/2022 10:24 PM term that\'s come up for what R\'Kesh is, that makes him go Wanderer... Star-Touched. D — 07/11/2022 10:15 AM Can indicate someone going Wanderer in someone else\'s name/on someone else\'s uncompleted quest, for example, the one down the right side of Val\'s face is like the one down R\'Kesh\'s. D — 07/11/2022 10:14 AM Meaning that at one point early in Co-Op history, there were probably almost as many humans with Novayan tattoos, as Novayans. The tattoos indicate, at a glance, a couple of things... one being an adoptive kin relationship (the chin tattoo that Val has, which is identical to K\'Ratha\'s and R\'Kesh\'s) across time and space which not only identifies you to another person you know but it also identifies you as a member of that kin-group to their descendants (fictive in the case of Wanderers, more than literal). D — 06/18/2022 9:39 PM They also have etiquette around eye contact, greetings, etc. You don\'t just get up in someone\'s whiskers, a way they often will be affectionate is to take your hand and rub it on your face, then maaaaybe proceed to a face rub. You will see bowing and possibly some different gestures as parts of polite exchange and there is probably actually a fairly formalized difference in language by context. Within the clanstead vs outside. R\'Kesh, as a former champion, speaks both wild and village D — 06/17/2022 9:05 PM I can see this with K\'Ratha, who never sired. Was a competitor but lost early on and went Wanderer. R\'Kesh (his brother) joined him in that lodge later. D — 06/17/2022 8:55 PM Clan champions often just go off. Lots just get snipped later and stay in the clan as a mentor and parental figure, and it\'s actually considered part of the aspirational path of being a clan champion. Like, in R\'Kesh\'s case... if he hadn\'t been called to be Wanderer, and followed that path, he could\'ve had a good, long life and raised his kits. D — 06/17/2022 8:01 PM Next about Novayans: we\'ve figured that Novayans send all kinds of Novayans out into exile. Some will become Wanderers, who are guided by their particular dream vision or are tied to a Life Quest, some will just live in the wild and go feral. R\'Kesh was guided by a vision of his ancestors who came through the Wormhole, and it\'s something that may lurk deep in Novayan epigenetics, given that Novayans are many descended from a few. D — 06/16/2022 11:04 AM I am imagining Val and R\'Kesh having a quarrel now and him stalking her to the bathroom to continue it after she walks off in the middle. D — 06/16/2022 11:00 AM R\'Kesh as navigator probably swapped out some different interfaces when he came on shift. You would not be able to do this in a SafMod-compliant ship quite the same way, if at all. Also what jobs Novayans tend to have on a ship, will probably affect how much space walk stuff they do. I\'m comfortable saying they are probably more likely to do some jobs than others. Also being a navigator has some traditional aspirationalism to it, culturally speaking. D — 06/15/2022 7:29 PM I am looking at this from a very Novayan-centric point of view that\'s probably going to be some conversation between Val and R\'Kesh sitting in the hold some late night. D — 06/15/2022 11:21 AM When R\'Kesh (in story) makes the observation that Val has what Novayans refer to in some humans as "cat senses" (except for cat proprioception lol) that made me think, I have to think about what Novayan senses even ARE, from the point of view of a Novayan. (edited) D — 06/15/2022 11:13 AM (This comes up in the novel because R\'Kesh - it\'s a fucking SHAME he\'s not a viewpoint character! Unless of course his writing ended up in Val\'s care. And that is giving me some threads to think on regarding the role of a witness of some kind - your pair bond, your kin - to a Wanderer\'s life and deeds. I could have a scene where she takes his writing, goes before the Lodge, and finally reads it. And it\'s an acknowledgment of completing his Quest. [1] He\'ll get some kind of marker on the Lodge territory, and possibly assigned a star [2]. Unless of course the star in the Kybaria system, is R\'Kesh\'s Star.) (edited) Message could not be loaded. D — 06/13/2022 11:14 PM Thinking on these dynamics, I feel that K\'Ratha may have had some uncomfortable feelings toward Val because R\'Kesh had followed a vision - to go fulfill this quest - and ended up with this human. K\'Ratha fucked around a lot, sure, and was popular all over the ship during the long voyages, but R\'Kesh - the one driven out to space because of his visions - after all of that, actually became a bonded pair with a human. D — 06/13/2022 10:28 AM But staying in the clan as Cut-Ear has a lot of perks. You\'re a permanent family member and get to participate in raising and training the kits. In R\'Kesh\'s case, if he had stayed within the clan for as long as he could defend his title and then gone Cut-Ear, he would\'ve had a good life, a long one, guaranteed. D — 06/13/2022 9:59 AM I\'ve thought a bit of temperamental differences between males and females, and gendered stereotypes (as well as which males and females break them). One thing that comes up for me via the relationship between R\'Kesh and Val is that he saw this woman who parses as heavily butch by conventional, contemporary (as in, today) standards, as feminine by Novayan standards. And many Novayans would see conventional dolled-up human women as being like lazy men by comparison (assuming the human in question isn\'t a fighter/athletic/a physical worker). (edited) D — 06/11/2022 12:37 PM (Something R\'Kesh said of himself and Val, was that they shared the same Star. Basically the same quest. Him, it was the proof that his ancestors came through a forgotten wormhole; her, it related to something in story called The Ansible Problem and tying it to the Machine Plague, one of which her father died from.) D — 06/11/2022 11:24 AM This is helping me sort something with R\'Kesh\'s quest, and K\'Ratha possibly feeling resentful of Val for taking him from that quest he\'d gone into space for. He saw nothing else once he met her. D — 06/11/2022 11:17 AM ...the specific song R\'Kesh had recorded with the rune chant in it, Val decoded as coordinates, it may have been an ancestral song. D — 06/11/2022 10:54 AM Ah shit. K\'Ratha followed R\'Kesh into space, not the other way. Though R\'Kesh spins it the other way. D — 06/11/2022 12:38 AM I gotta think on Novayans and the Life Quest, at least in the case of R\'Kesh. He left behind what would\'ve been a secure, even high status, comfortable life and became Wanderer, and I\'m feeling a Seer would\'ve endorsed this and marked him, and... what was this based on, a dream? D — 06/02/2022 2:53 PM Think of a Novayan beauty pageant winner if they had to defend their title in a duel every year, get sterilized, or become an exile. And recognized early as prime beefcake and groomed into the role. This gives context to Wanderer and why R\'Kesh saw Val as one too. (edited) D — 06/02/2022 2:49 PM The thing with R\'Kesh makes me kind of sad. His work ultimately opened the Ways. It took a female taking on his work after he pointlessly died in a bar stabbing to get it taken seriously. Otherwise, Novayans just saw him as a waste of perfectly good genes. He\'s also considered an exceptionally handsome male. D — 05/30/2022 8:39 PM Anyway, thinking about how it would\'ve gone with a Novayan female that R\'Kesh met Wandering - who he\'d probably have gone to find some territory with, and started a family, and then eventually gotten fixed and become the patriarch/mentor over her future litters. That will probably help me brainstorm how this goes, given he and Val basically intend to just Wander forever. He may be a unique soul, a dreamer who had to leave to continue his work, and it may be because he didn\'t do the traditional thing - a traditional Novayan partnership - that the work even got passed on to someone who completed it. D — 05/30/2022 9:02 AM ...so this character R\'Kesh left Novaya because of structural sexism basically Jump D — 05/29/2022 9:49 PM Val\'s tape of R\'Kesh\'s singing is going to come into play later in her story, I\'m thinking that his giving her something like that would mean something coming from a Novayan. human-culture-stuff D — 03/29/2022 10:34 AM I\'m gonna say that some of the ones Val has, were actually given to her by R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha. When she gets the quest mark though that will be done by a Seer. (edited) aliens D — 02/22/2022 7:54 PM The shared responsibility to the lodge thing is more "pay it forward" given the asynchronous nature of spacer life sometimes (some being intersystem "light chasers," some never returning home in their lifetime etc), that ensures continuity. I think that K\'Ratha is upset specifically about Val just fucking off to space an hour after R\'Kesh\'s murder, but there\'s possibly no obligation for her to have come back in her lifetime. She and K\'Ratha were supposed to have continued to work with the lodge, and continued their work, but she didn\'t grieve with him, or bear R\'Kesh\'s body back to the lodge, and the rift kept that work together from happening. D — 02/22/2022 7:46 PM ...ah fuck, that\'s heavy, R\'Kesh would\'ve had a visit to the Seer before all of this... wonder what she told him. He died a few years later. (edited) D — 02/22/2022 7:39 PM anyway for the wedding, it\'s basically acknowledging your bonded pair before some figure important to the lodge on Novaya, for example, I think Val\'s and R\'Kesh\'s was done by a Seer. logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 02/20/2022 5:56 PM (Val\'s chin tat is a r\'ketha. K\'Ratha has the same one and so did R\'Kesh.) character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 02/06/2022 6:23 PM ...it\'s absolutely possible that R\'Kesh had kits at some point, what if that\'s actually his son? D — 02/06/2022 6:23 PM oh I could do something fucked up. I\'ve maintained that R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha are brothers this whole time, and R\'Kesh initially says this, but he\'s fiercely protective of him D — 02/04/2022 11:01 AM ...and something coming up for R\'Kesh is that: like humans, spacing since his mid-teens. aliens D — 01/26/2022 11:25 AM Also, if she ended up with it... the thought is, he may have ended up with it from someone else and given the meaning Novayans attach to so many little things - a person who has that kind of thing, may have a cultural obligation to it, and to the memory of that person. R\'Kesh himself may have been carrying a life quest to find the Ways. D — 01/26/2022 11:13 AM It\'s possible some of these still exist among Novayans - heck, Val may have R\'Kesh\'s. He might have given it to her. But it\'s possible that the cultural knowledge of the link to Way navigation has been lost over time. D — 01/24/2022 9:17 PM R\'Kesh increasingly feels not like K\'Ratha\'s littermate, but from a previous litter. He just feels like an older brother to me. D — 01/23/2022 11:32 PM Of note is that in my writing about R\'Kesh, he saw his human partner (a very unfeminine woman) as girly by Novayan standards. setting-research-crap D — 01/19/2022 9:48 PM apropos of R\'Kesh\'s job as a navigator. One of the common Novayan jobs character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 01/19/2022 9:48 PM apropos of R\'Kesh\'s job: http://www.projectrho.com/public\\_html/rocket/astrodeck.php aliens D — 01/14/2022 3:52 PM So something I\'m working out is that Val retreating into solitude and possibly even an addiction, was taken by K\'Ratha (R\'Kesh\'s brother) as an outright betrayal. (edited) spacers-space-setting D — 01/12/2022 11:42 AM Thinking about the layout of habs on the Co-Op MCT that Val, R\'Kesh, and K\'Ratha are on in this thing I\'m writing. aliens D — 01/11/2022 10:47 PM They\'re reputed to have big personalities, though that actually varies person to person. R\'Kesh was calm and quiet, someone who on the homeworld was good at tracking, and was now a navigator. general-bullshit D — 01/09/2022 9:54 AM And if some males simply give up their balls later on by choice, and go home to their mother clan. Kind of wondering if R\'Kesh\'s brother did, after R\'Kesh was killed. D — 01/09/2022 9:48 AM I need to make R\'Kesh\'s himbo brother a ginger. D — 01/09/2022 9:45 AM Something I have fun with is the idea that masculinity/femininity attributes are partially cultural and my Novayan character R\'Kesh definitely sees his very butchy human girlfriend as a girly girl. (edited) aliens Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 11:04 AM The clan adoption thing would be a mutual step, which means some Novayan had to figure out how to render Val\'s human family information into Novayan script for R\'Kesh\'s tat. D — 01/07/2022 10:58 AM I keep wanting her taking the face mark actually having some kind of narrative heft later, because she does the wormhole dive to fulfill R\'Kesh\'s life quest, and I feel there is a period where she pushed K\'Ratha and the others away instead of grieving with them, and had to come to terms with that and face it. D — 01/07/2022 10:49 AM K\'Ratha I think is R\'Kesh\'s brother brother and they became spacers together. Caffeine Delusions — 01/07/2022 10:48 AM Eh, you said extended family and I started thinking \'R\'kesh had cousins and nieces and stuff, right?\' Jump D — 01/07/2022 10:35 AM It struck me more and more as I started to flesh out in my head, the relationship between Val and R\'Kesh, that it to some degree could be meta on humans and Novayans and gives me a lot of opportunity to explore that. His brother K\'Ratha is the himbo, and the one who hops from rack to rack on every trip, R\'Kesh (navigator) is the poet. logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 01/02/2022 10:59 PM @Caffeine Delusions I revised it slightly, K\'Ratha is actually one of R\'Kesh\'s brothers. character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/31/2021 9:15 AM ok, R\'Kesh (dead love) was a navigator. (And I\'m going to hazard to guess that this is a common Novayan specialization. Something they even hold in esteem. You may see Novayan pilots a lot, too.) logos-symbols-patches-candy D — 12/30/2021 11:41 AM ...maybe R\'Kesh dreamed of flying with the mission that found the storied Ways across the Void. (Extension of Novayan beliefs about roads and track ways on their world, I\'m gonna say.) And being able to sing about it. (edited) D — 12/30/2021 11:32 AM If K\'Ratha were who killed the other dude (R\'Kesh\'s killer) then it may be that Sparks and K\'Ratha ended up estranged because he denied her the right of vengeance. He knew she would\'ve been killed, herself. She didn\'t care. (edited) character-archetypes-and-ux-personae D — 12/26/2021 2:06 PM Let R\'Kesh have it. D — 12/26/2021 1:01 PM The other dude initially attacked, R\'Kesh got a couple of good stabs in, but didn\'t kill the other dude fast enough to not get his throat ripped out. Caffeine Delusions — 12/26/2021 12:20 PM Was this before or after you decided R\'Kesh was going to get stabbed over a girl he wasn\'t even making a play for? D — 12/26/2021 12:15 PM ...I unconsciously wrote my partner into R\'Kesh a bit and now I\'m fucking myself up. D — 12/26/2021 11:39 AM R\'Kesh probably flirted with Sparks by knocking over stuff in her space and laying on her stuff. D — 12/25/2021 8:44 PM R\'Kesh of Novaya D — 12/06/2022 11:19 PM also shit this got more intense because what\'s coming up is that R\'Kesh is the first person he remembers, he\'s practically like her North Star for that reason. But she doesn\'t remember yet that he\'s dead. Jump writing-crap D — 10/13/2022 9:09 AM A thing happening with Val is that with the interspersing of "always known I\'m not like these fucks/shit going bad with humans/adventures with R\'Kesh" and stuff happening on Kybaria, I am getting a different picture D — 10/07/2022 1:58 PM Right as she got with R\'Kesh she started to realize that almost every single normie social/sexual outlet for humans was basically closed off to her, and people in her world were going on to their next milestone and leaving her behind. D — 10/07/2022 1:55 PM Anyway Rowantree will come up right before Val meets her husband R\'Kesh. As for her, I think she expected to join a commune because so many people just did it. The common pattern with going to advanced placement and then Pre is to get your education done early, get done with the minimum amount of space time to qualify for Co-Op benefits, then go make as many babies as you possibly can. The way CoStanSyn\'s and ItSyn\'s educational and training and benefits pipeline were set up for the first few generations of the Co-Op, totally enabled this. Human population in the settlements has exploded in the last 40 years, enough for the very human-dominant Safeties to arise as a political faction, vs the older human/alien solidarity oriented CoStans (who also tend to be friendlier to private enterprise and the cultural and economic autonomy of individual traditional human cultural groups like the Space Salish). (edited) general D — 10/04/2022 10:56 PM Ok, this is helping me think out Chapter 2. I think she\'s been having some vague dreams of R\'Kesh, though that didn\'t get mentioned in 1, and then the kitty wiener dreams in chapter 2. Message could not be loaded. D — 10/04/2022 10:28 PM Ok, that works. I\'m surprised that since she\'s been there a week, she hasn\'t dreamt of R\'Kesh yet, or maybe she has. D — 10/04/2022 10:18 PM R\'Kesh has to figure in here somewhere, given he\'s her dead husband and she\'s basically here because of a broken heart. writing-crap D — 09/30/2022 2:47 PM She\'s figured out that she must be a spacer given the things present and is having some tactile memories connected to the things. What she will remember next is a good question, any possibility she thinks R\'Kesh still alive? I feel like ordering the story this way is kind of messing with a few things in my head and I need to figure out what she remembers and when and chart that out. (edited) D — 09/17/2022 4:04 PM "When I was in the hospital (injury 10 months ago) I still thought my ex and I were together even though we had broken up a year prior." ...ah shit, has implications for R\'Kesh. D — 09/17/2022 12:48 PM Her chin tattoo is a mark of kinship between her, K\'Ratha, and R\'Kesh. The one down the right side of her face is from undertaking a life quest; if her body had been found then it would\'ve been obvious to any Novayans that she had died carrying a Novayan\'s quest out, given enough context cues to show it\'s not fake. She has tattoos indicating how many generations of Co-Op spacer she is, some that basically echo some of her rating patches, some showing number of light runs, and a braided tribal looking wristband that echoes the Weave bracelet (basically indicating she was married.) Whatever else idk. The Co-Op CO symbol too because that becomes a plot point. potentially-nsfw D — 07/14/2022 8:41 PM R\'Kesh falling in love with Val would\'ve put a giant potential hamper on that. And K\'Ratha did come to accept Val, but only over time, and kind of begrudgingly. Val fucking off after R\'Kesh died, put a crimp in that for years - a couple for Val, and enough for K\'Ratha (due to staying dirtside and not going light-chasing anymore) to be graying by the time Val returned to Novaya. (edited) D — 07/14/2022 8:33 PM But that leaves K\'Ratha, himself also Wanderer. The two had pledged to keep each other honest, basically: R\'Kesh to K\'Ratha, to keep the smaller and less disciplined male, who had been denied mating, from getting himself killed while he basically went out and had an extended Novayan rumspringa, before going home to become Cut-Ear; and K\'Ratha to R\'Kesh, to make sure that R\'Kesh fulfilled his Life Quest that had driven him out of the village, and it involved an actual project and actual research. D — 07/14/2022 8:31 PM R\'Kesh went Wanderer because of his visions of the stars, and such a thing - I bet they even say something that translates as "star struck" - is akin to being called by the Ancestors. I think that when he got together with Val, he felt that he was possibly supposed to meet her, and anything beyond where he was, called no more. D — 07/14/2022 8:29 PM Every time I scratch the surface of anythign I end up with more story showing up that has to be written, I really think that there has to have been drama between Val and K\'Ratha, and ultimately her fulfilling R\'Kesh\'s life quest, was out of debt to K\'Ratha too. Thinking about how close two cat brothers, traveling the stars together, must have been. I really feel that there is a thing with Novayans traveling in pairs and witnessing each other\'s deeds, and keeping each other on the path, because an individual, off alone, can so easily stray. Message could not be loaded. D — 07/14/2022 2:24 PM Novayans probably don\'t use blankets. Be funny though if they like tightly packed nests. Just because I want an excuse for R\'Kesh\'s brother to be found sleeping off a hangover in a box. writing-crap D — 07/13/2022 7:59 PM Yeah, that\'s what she and R\'Kesh had planned, with his brother. Couple of robots and a good ship, and they\'d have a life. And the shared obsession with the theoretical wormhole. His vision that sent him Wanderer, had been of that. art-show-and-tell D — 07/05/2022 4:00 PM K\'Ratha and R\'Kesh singing in a tavern writing-crap D — 06/10/2022 7:48 PM Thinking on R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha, it\'s easy to see R\'Kesh as the stable and steady one, and K\'Ratha as the impulsive one who\'s going to get himself killed But it\'s weird because I can see it the other way around from another point of view. D — 05/26/2022 10:40 AM But also she\'s running with Wanderers and I need to actually put in some story where that actually matters and isn\'t just something dropped in that never comes up again. It\'s got to have been something that came up at some point. That said, her main devotion is specifically to R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha, and Wanderer affiliation is diffuse and possibly decentralized (there are some Co-Op Spacer culture elements that filtered down from Novayan Wanderers), and Novayans outside of their own families may be wired to socialize individual-to-individual. D — 05/23/2022 10:31 AM The Seer knew that R\'Kesh was part of something bigger, passing this Life Quest along, and eventually he would meet the next person to take it. She might have known as well that it would not be K\'Ratha - who went home to become Cut-Ear and help raise kits within the clan. D — 05/23/2022 10:25 AM The Novayan returning, will be sung back into the lodge - it may be by descendants of those who sung him away. What knowledge (or whatever else) he brings with him will be brought into the lodge; if you make a promise as a Novayan you may be fulfilling it on the descendants of whomever you promised it to, or onto your lodge-kin down the road. It has implications for Val\'s taking R\'Kesh\'s Life Quest, because she fulfills that then brings the knowledge he sought back to his lodge. Some years have passed, but it was a long term Life Quest that had probably been passed among various Novayans. Once one has been fulfilled, it\'s retired and not passed along anymore. The role of the Seer is pointed out here too because when R\'Kesh went Wanderer, he would\'ve had a Seer read him before going. (edited) D — 05/23/2022 10:15 AM R\'Kesh and his brother K\'Ratha at the point of writing belong to a lodge or brotherhood of other Wanderers; there are a couple of other human spacers in it, Val is brought in too, and lodges among Novayans can have the weight of syndicates. (Well, with the exception of big mega-syndicates like ItSyn.) Your other memberships will matter possibly in terms of politics/loyalties but being in a lodge is one of the options. D — 05/22/2022 10:05 PM MIL is in love with R\'Kesh (Val\'s late husband, have been reading her chapters, a giant chunk of the first half of the saga is about him) orphan-sky-chat D — 05/20/2022 3:24 PM Having a fun time with the superstitious/spiritual nature of the Novayans. Feeling that R\'Kesh went Wanderer because a Seer told him to, and felt that out there, with his life guided by the Stars Themselves, he would do something important that she foresaw. He met Val on the life quest that he took, and Val took on that quest for him. But I think there is a thing of, "you are who I was supposed to meet out here, in the black." He would not have known that Val would be taking on his life quest after his death, and completing it for him (and everyone who\'d carried that same uncompleted quest over the centuries). But the Seer may have foreseen something. (edited) music-and-vids-and-crap D — 05/17/2022 2:14 PM this is for the Novayans, but especially R\'Kesh. D — 04/23/2022 7:09 PM Even if it\'s a world that she fell into having gone Wanderer with R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha. Jump writing-crap D — 04/05/2022 9:55 AM R\'Kesh and I walked along the path through the Arboretum that connected the main atrium to the soundproofed Nadiran Quarter of Perimeter Two. The quiet suited a Novayan’s even sharper ears. The atrium’s echo had given way to the growing quiet of the Arboretum path, and further down the curving path, I heard the faint bell of a Krayahan shrine keeping the time, and looked up at R’Kesh to see that his ears and whiskers had perked; he’d heard it too. He stopped and tensed momentarily, his attention drawn away, and from my time around Novayans, I knew that any moment, he would be halfway down the path ahead of me, regardless of what we had been talking about in the moment, and he probably would not even remember what that had been. I kept my eyes straight ahead, anticipating his bounding off. As much as I’ve traveled with Novayans and found a kinship with them, it’s one of the things that reminds me we’re not the same. And that didn’t happen. R’Kesh looked up at the source of the sound, then looked back at me, still attentive. His eyelids narrowed briefly, and he averted his gaze again, which I understood to be Novayan politeness. orphan-sky-chat D — 03/29/2022 11:21 AM ...their attention also can shift at a moment\'s notice failing something being actually life or death. (Everything is life or death in space and it suits them.) You\'re standing there talking to your Novayan syndic friend when you\'re at port and you turn around, and he\'s gone, and it\'s because something caught his notice. This is worse with Novayans who are idle, and they\'re usually off looking for fun the moment they step off the ship, depending. (They vary in temperament as much as humans, and R\'Kesh felt ready to settle down.) Their ears, tails, and noses lead them to surprising places sometimes. They\'re sharp on the job though. (edited) D — 03/20/2022 1:19 PM I feel like I need to write her history prior to R\'Kesh just to show how wrong it went with humans. Like, this is someone whose sexual orientation is "aliens" (edited) D — 03/16/2022 8:14 PM (Val and R\'Kesh) D — 03/15/2022 6:53 PM This only works if I do even more backfill with R\'Kesh and actually show some of their late night talks before they got together. Then show Odyl feeding into that particular love language. (This is my own dark side that I had to get past. I\'m just shoving that right in there.) D — 03/11/2022 2:58 PM Oh def, though in R\'Kesh\'s case, as a space worker, he probably cut them really close so that means nails are out for him. But I\'m thinking about the female Novayan merchant that\'s inspired by our cat whom we nicknamed Jabba the Slut. writing-crap D — 03/10/2022 8:40 PM taking the life-quest of R\'Kesh... she perceives this as an act of desperation and has suicidal ideation at that point. D — 03/10/2022 8:38 PM And her whole situation with K\'Ratha after R\'Kesh is killed, is perceived as pretty callous. D — 03/10/2022 8:02 PM I think there is stuff I glossed over - there\'s stuff from Val\'s childhood that will be relevant later - and I think I want to tuck that into some discussion with R\'Kesh, and that there is other R\'Kesh stuff that will get bulked up too, like, it\'s going to fuck us all up harder on the 2nd draft. D — 03/01/2022 7:42 AM Kind of a segue. But i wrote that before R\'Kesh, her attempts to be sexual with anyone in port usually involved booze, because the experience was otherwise so off-putting. (edited) D — 02/28/2022 9:22 PM All their plans died with R\'Kesh, and she didn\'t come back to grieve with him either. D — 02/28/2022 9:20 PM He woke up with no memory of what had happened, only that R\'Kesh had thrown himself between K\'Ratha and a roid raging Novayan assailant. D — 02/28/2022 9:19 PM K\'Ratha had been totally given over to emotion, borderline frenzy, and he\'d gotten hit by a trank when R\'Kesh died. D — 02/28/2022 9:16 PM K\'Ratha took it as a betrayal of both him and R\'Kesh, and her not facing him, as cowardice. He became cut ear. Went back to his clan. Began to distrust humans. D — 02/28/2022 9:15 PM But she\'s got to get there from here, and I think that the journey after R\'Kesh\'s death is coming up. What happened after R\'Kesh died, was that she got back on the ship, instead of seeing to K\'Ratha, or going back with him to Novaya. D — 02/28/2022 9:09 PM Val has got to have an arc after R\'Kesh\'s death, where she pushes herself to try to deal with the humans in her syndicate, tries to reach out, and it just fucks her harder. D — 02/28/2022 4:09 PM Something that came up for me - it\'s just stuff I don\'t even know where to work into the story yet - is that she drank her way through all of her sexual encounters previous to R\'Kesh, then gave up on the whole idea because she realized that most people didn\'t need to drink to have sex in port. potentially-nsfw D — 02/27/2022 9:59 AM R\'Kesh of course has this background and is a high status male who\'s had kits, because of course he\'s the romanticized hero of a monsterfucker/sexy alien novel, and Dead Spouse is always somewhat idealized a character. (edited) D — 02/27/2022 9:35 AM R\'Kesh just knew one day and it was too late. writing-crap D — 02/23/2022 9:55 AM Like, her whole relationship with R\'Kesh is so sweet, and I feel like there\'s a ton in the beginning that just got left out of what I wrote. D — 02/17/2022 8:59 PM I\'m feeling that her walking away after R\'Kesh died, is treated as a major bad. D — 02/17/2022 8:55 PM I\'m figuring that she was brought into R\'Kesh\'s specific lodge, and that this isn\'t unheard of for non-Novayans, and there are lodges that are even mostly non-Novayan. (It\'s interesting to consider given what I\'ve characterized of the social order of a bit of the Inmost, and also because I\'m establishing that Novayans\' origins are within the Inmost.) D — 02/06/2022 5:16 PM @Caffeine Delusions, I think Val does connect to the Co-Op somewhat as an ideology. It\'s her main point of connection, she has next to no family nor even any human "fam" to speak of, she\'s never had anyone previous to (or subsequent to) R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha, but she\'s had this one thing that\'s responsible for her not ending up a drug mule, in a gang, or having to sell her body at some shithole like Three Points East, that was there for her in some abstract fashion (giving her the means to avoid what could have been a rather gruesome fate) when her family wasn\'t. And when her human family wasn\'t there for her, aliens were. (edited) D — 01/23/2022 8:15 PM But... I actually like R\'Kesh and he was a good dude. The kind of person who\'d put himself in between his brother and some big frenzied Novayan thug and die for it. D — 01/20/2022 7:03 PM R\'Kesh again Jump writing-crap D — 01/15/2022 8:17 PM Preferably something they can play while they sing, but if not, in the case of the thing I\'m writing with R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha, one of them plays the thing (like if it\'s a little ocarina or something) and the other sings. potentially-nsfw D — 01/13/2022 7:37 PM ...K\'Ratha inadvertently got him killed. Got up to something stupid in the presence of another male, R\'Kesh got between them, and got his throat cut. I think K\'Ratha went home and got fixed after that. D — 01/13/2022 7:33 PM I have a fucked up thought about how R\'Kesh died. D — 01/13/2022 7:23 PM Thinking about bros R\'Kesh and K\'Ratha here lol writing-crap D — 01/13/2022 5:00 PM And... I tend to get really into writing my characters\' relationship arcs (though it\'s almost never the central part of the story - there\'s no telling this specific story though without this because her bond with him, his people, and her arc after his loss, absolutely are the central movers of the story) And something interesting to me is how every relationship dynamic I\'ve written, has been different, and a specific dynamic is not even something I can set out to portray. What makes it really sad about Sparks and R\'Kesh though is that they were youngish people who were supposed to have a life together, they were together quite a few years before he died, she had been utterly alone (and rather alienated) before him, she got to actually feel joy for once with him, and she came this close to being able to dream, because of him, then spent much of the next decade just being ground down by life and unable to find her way back to the world. And she has to carry out the promises she made to him and other Novayans, to be complete, and that\'s the arc about how she came to wear the tabby marks, but also about actually having enough of a social tie inside the Co-Op to matter (since she can\'t form, for whatever reason, meaningful bonds with humans), she couldn\'t just expect to be a lone wolf and actually get her work taken seriously. It ends up, in its own way, being something that\'s a foundational story of the early work of DSES. \\*\\*\\*']
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> The braiding/weaving in custom that @Caffeine Delusions came up with, came from Novayan spacers and was part of traditions that are a way identity and history get passed on in an individualistic culture, and it became something many spacer humans connected to because of condition of often not having families or even other members of their cultures in their new situation I’ve thought the cats might do ritual body mods that are basically a tattoo that’s both cut and inked. I wonder if the mark Sparks has on her face comes from a Novayan custom originally. I have to think about what it means. It communicates information to anyone seeing it. If it’s a Novayan symbol it buys some social capital with novayans. Given every Novayan mark has contextual meaning. Nadiran find humans brash and impulsive but a bit better than Novayans who are even more brash and impulsive and also smelly and even more violent. Anyone who doesn’t live as long as they do is potentially a dangerous savage child race. Stereotypes of Novayans: passionate, impulsive romantics; a bit "Puss in Boots" in space. They're also individualistic, and the most individualist culture. There are elements of human spacer culture on the Perimeter that come from the Novayan influence, because Novayans were working those lanes for various employers before humans even showed up. I really feel @Caffeine Delusions's "weaving in"/"woven in life" ideas evolved from what may have been an existing element of Novayan culture. Especially in an oral trad culture, which Novayans are. (No problem with not showing their writing system.) I'm doing a brief write up of the origin of @Caffeine Delusions' weave/braid custom and placing it as a syncretic custom that evolved in relationship between humans and novayans... This is making some assumptions about culture transmission that are very, very inconvenient to modern discourse. The Orphans of Earth were human immigrants to alien space. Novayans were the existing workers of the space lanes. They worked side by side for about 3 generations, at least - there are customs that have evolved from that interaction that aren't purely human, aren't purely Novayan, and that doesn't matter to anyone. I'm nailing it as originally a Novayan custom. Called r'khatha. Novayans have informal brotherhood customs, and there's some weird gendering in that they're a very gendered culture with some sex-essentialist species traits, but anyone who gets considered brother to a Novayan, is going to be called that regardless of their own gender identity. Novayans only have one term for this. Novayans have worked the space lanes for generations, even previous to humans getting there, so there's a probability that some other culture group they worked with did genetic scanning and probably was taking gene samples of them. It evolved further as more and more Novayans braided humans, and humans braided other humans. Novayan brotherhood groups are not based on shared bloodlines, which made them scalable to other species too. (edited) Novayan males' #1 cause of death is other Novayan males. A bit. Also, it gives you a chance to show off a Novayan with a spectacular hairstyle in the character's backstory and art. Maybe she's still in contact with some of his Found Family brothers because they grieved together. All Novayan males have manes (females too, but much shorter) and I've just now decided that they put braids and baubles in their hair. This gives me a chance to develop the Novayans more, too. I know that the way I want to portray it is that humans hook up with bipedal cats all the damned time and nobody ever remarks on it. Everyone always wants to party with the Novayan. Novayans seem like a lot of them are horndogs who are interacting with other species because they want to fuck. Like, very apres ski/shore leave atmosphere. Or even heading to sex tourism levels in some cases I think Novayans have a reputation for being party animals. Novayans are a culture that Perimeter Humans have had a lot of interaction with, especially working for the Co-Op. Like... I don't even think a human/Novayan relationship, especially between space workers, is necessarily that remarkable in setting. Something I"m enjoying contrasting is some of the human characters' sense of grim get-on-with-it mentality with the Novayans, who I think are very expressive, and very open about their emotions This has fascinating implications because there's an implication that if males have to be deballed to live among females full time, the equivalent may be true of females living among males. Though I've implied female Novayan spacers often take a suppressant med. Im sure there are Novayans who object to Novayans doing any high tech interventions on their mating cycle, as well as Novayans who are probably speciesist and culturally purist. And it probably goes together. Likely... but there are also probably Novayans who can only really get an actual quality of life because of technological interventions and diverse communities, so the middle is probably somewhere between the two. Also, random thought, maybe I'm actually starting to wake up, but... Novayan Kittens. It's interesting that despite sex essentialist culture, these don't map to gender identity for Novayans. It's just a cold blooded necessity due to their biology unless they actually want to revert to being feral hunters full time. It may be connected to "this is the difference between us and ANIMALS." I'm going more generalized, though there are some phenotypes of Novayan (which I suppose maps a bit to human "races" except that Novayans may not ascribe the same meaning to it at all) that have a particular look, such as the silver-furred blue-eyed Northerners with their luxuriant fur, and the tawny short-furred Southerners. Novayans: the Catfolk of the Perimeter (notes and sundry) Novayans: the Catfolk of the Perimeter (notes and sundry) The Novayans have been in space longer than humans have. They do not know where they originally come from - only that they have traveled far, traveled wide, seen much, and vow to return to their childhood home to bring their stories back home to their family’s oral history, which they refer to, poetically, as Weaving: joining their personal story of their adventures gained far afield, to their home. Novayans have special customs related to wandering and coming home, as well as customs related to the track ways and roads they travel - but especially, for those that go Wandering in space, for space itself, where they are in the hands of their ancestral Guides and live by the wisdom imparted in their songs. . Some of their folk songs reference “the Ways Across the Void,” thought to be a poetic device to refer to their earliest history during a time of legends, before they settled the world on which they live. These songs refer to trackways and roads - described as tunnels in space - that their ancestors used to navigate to their homeworld. To be the Novayan that can prove the existence of such a thing, to live in the stars as Guide in one’s death to the generations of travelers after them, is something any Wanderer would love to claim. \*\* Plenty of humans loved Novayans, but more enjoyed them casually. They had a reputation: sooner or later, the urge to wander would take over, and the Novayan would be off on his next flight. A Novayan male’s life was his and his alone, if even on his own world, that life risked being nasty, brutish, and short. From the first day that their quick, light feet took them to the new spaceport the Nadiran spacing authority had put on their world, they’d set another path to wander, seeking their Guides among the stars themselves. And when the Nadiran left, and the Men (as the Nadiran called them) came – the terms were amenable, and more Novayans wandered offworld than ever before. Usually they came back – even if they were no match for some of the older, tougher Wanderers living outside the villages, females actually preferred a guy with a throat full of songs and a chest, back, and face full of the cut and inked glyphs of storied deeds. Stories of epic failure, even imprisonment, were preferable to having done nothing at all. What was the point of being a Wanderer at all, if not to have a song to sing about it? May as well stay home and give up your balls! But sometimes Wanderers stayed away. If they had a mate offworld – they might never return. They had no control over this whatsoever. One could not help who one loved, and a Novayan who could help that, probably was… broken, or something. But there was this. Within an actual pair, a male could potentially live longer, could have a much better life, especially if their partner were intelligent and nimble and strong. Be that partner male or female, that did not matter offworld, though if female – and given good hunting territory – they might form a clan of their own. There were more males offworld, so there were plenty of Novayan male companions who worked the lanes together. But a non-Novayan, now? That was not unheard of, either. From the time the first Novayans left their world, they had taken up with aliens. Their reserved, imperious Nadiran employers had no interest in them, and the feeling was very much mutual. The statuesque Altikhari warrior women who worked the lanes with them, sometimes took them to bed for a night, but it wasn’t much more than that, and… the preferences of Altikhari could be… unique even by cat standards, and we will just leave it at that. But then humans arrived. And inevitably, sometimes Novayans took up with them. Humans proved to be even more fickle than Novayans had the reputation for being. But not always. It would not matter if they had been. Because Novayans loved who they loved, and they had no say over this, just as they had no say in the matters of their ancestral Guides who shined down on them from above and guided the Wanderers in their Wandering. To be disappointed in love was as worthy of poetry and song as to win at it. Only a broken Novayan never dared. Only the most pitiful Novayan should ever return home with no tale to tell, having gotten his ears and tail into no trouble at all! \*\* Novayans don't have anything resembling a theocrat or a theocat, I think they are totally into woowoo and lore and myth and probably have their witches and shaman figures. It's probably another thing about them that seems vaguely Norse. Novayans actually in a bonded pair (not super super common, but frequent enough) have some resistance to frenzying at the scent of those pheromones though. Novayans have oral tradition about sailing ships in the sky and an animistic, individualistic belief system with soothsayers and elders and dream-ships traveling the Milky Way - called the Starry Path. I think that originally what happened is they became part of the interstellar community because someone spacefaring made first contact, possibly either a crash or someone traveling in a small group from far away, and the Novayans may have actually had the upper hand in the situation and began trading Bonding probably has a biochemical element in terms of discouraging Frenzy somewhat. At least due to the scent of females. A general calming of the temperament. I want to point out that my character's having a Novayan for a spouse, isn't unheard of. It's not super common, but not unheard of. Their reputation among offworlders is for sleeping around if they're not actually with anyone though. (edited) (I'm thinking Novayans have two separate sets of customs for your mates vs what you do during estrus. Estrus mating is mindless and sometimes people die. I wonder if females offworld sometimes use sperm donors.) I also think the females select against the worst, most frenzied Novayans and often choose the gentler ones with the shorter dickspines. It's just that in the wild, there's less choice. Maybe even that training is the rule for lots of males and only the ones who become champions, stay uncut anyway. I think Novayans see themselves as a civilized people with a beast core, not as beasts who happen to live in villages. They may loathe feraldom and the Frenzy in fact and many Novayans may be like, "if that ever happens to me, kill me." given the degree to which I'm painting Novayans as having kind of a romantic image to them, I should lean into the Beast as a little bit of design inspiration. “You like that I hit my brother for you for making the sex in your hab every night? If you like, R’Kesh hits him like the punching bag. One thousand times for K’Ratha.” “Yes,” Sparks said, between bites of her food. “Go ahead. Beat the ever living shit out of him. I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep since my roommates started passing him like a doob. Fuckin’ tomcat.” “The tomcat who is going to get himself killed extra-dead one day,” R’Kesh replied. Suddenly he had grown thoughtful and solemn. He looked down at the remaining ration of salmon cubes on his plate. “Novayan male life span, not that great. Tell me he is wrapping it up, ay?” Okay so the thing elsewhere about Novayans doing everything out in the open, and a recent attempt at my own bathroom privacy had me wondering - are they basically going to go up to random humans and hang out while the poor besieged one is just trying to take a crap in peace? I just imagine one going all wide-eyed and a little too close to the human's face and asking if they're taking a shit with this big absurd grin. Omg yes, need to have this scene. They'll just follow you and continue their conversation. The specific Novayan im focusing on seems somewhat worldly, but his brother (perhaps younger and not a littermate?) Would absolutely do that (edited) ...sanitation specialist among Novayans would be privy (ahem) to so much of the social scoop But... I actually like R'Kesh and he was a good dude. The kind of person who'd put himself in between his brother and some big frenzied Novayan thug and die for it. I'm figuring that she was brought into R'Kesh's specific lodge, and that this isn't unheard of for non-Novayans, and there are lodges that are even mostly non-Novayan. (It's interesting to consider given what I've characterized of the social order of a bit of the Inmost, and also because I'm establishing that Novayans' origins are within the Inmost.) Not necessarily. For purposes of Novayan culture, whether it's even recognizably "couply" is totally up to the bond, it's not even necessarily romantic, you can be in that kind of a pair bond with your sibling and they don't give a shit. They have very strict compartmentalization in their culture between procreative sex in season and whatever you do with your buddies and bondmates. Also another thing coming off with Novayans is that they have a warrior path, but it's not about becoming a better fighter or killer, they're already killers. R’Kesh went offworld after his mating, deciding that being a Clan Champion just wasn't worth it. He really wanted to study lore and travel, and he went Wanderer. Also, working in micro-g actually lowers Novayan testosterone levels just enough, they calm down a bit, aren't as subject to the wild swings they'd be subject to on Novaya, and over time the dick spines become nubs. Though they don't calm down as much as cut-ears calm down. (edited) Example of Novayan affection being different... instead of leaning in for a kiss, when he first wanted to express that... he brought her hand up to his face and rubbed his cheek on it. Novayans are perceiving Val taking R’Kesh’s life quest as some really foolhardy human daring the gods, or willing to die over what was actually not - to any Novayan other than K'Ratha personally, who was personally hurt - really that big of an offense. Novayans are actually more adapted to micro-g environments than humans are, in some ways. In the case of intact males, it's actually beneficial, as their hormones level out in space, and with the loss of smell, they lose some sensitivity to the female pheromones. They tend toward being ambidextrous, and their tails latch to a handhold, so they have both hands free. ...their attention also can shift at a moment's notice failing something being actually life or death. (Everything is life or death in space and it suits them.) You're standing there talking to your Novayan syndic friend when you're at port and you turn around, and he's gone, and it's because something caught his notice. This is worse with Novayans who are idle, and they're usually off looking for fun the moment they step off the ship, depending. (They vary in temperament as much as humans, and R'Kesh felt ready to settle down.) Their ears, tails, and noses lead them to surprising places sometimes. They're sharp on the job though. (edited) The other thing is that built spaces arranged specifically around Novayans, such as some clanships, aren't that comfortable - with usability consequences - to humans. But some stuff is also stuff like... not caring about privacy in some cases. Novayans don't feel that restrooms need a door nor that you shouldn't continue on a conversation with someone who's pooping. (edited) Though Novayans can operate at far lower levels of light than either Nadiran or human. An example of characterization of a Novayan. This is R’Kesh, as told by his wife Val: R'Kesh and I walked along the path through the Arboretum that connected the main atrium to the soundproofed Nadiran Quarter of Perimeter Two. The quiet suited a Novayan’s even sharper ears. The atrium’s echo had given way to the growing quiet of the Arboretum path, and further down the curving path, I heard the faint bell of a Krayahan shrine keeping the time, and looked up at R’Kesh to see that his ears and whiskers had perked; he’d heard it too. He stopped and tensed momentarily, his attention drawn away, and from my time around Novayans, I knew that any moment, he would be halfway down the path ahead of me, regardless of what we had been talking about in the moment, and he probably would not even remember what that had been. I kept my eyes straight ahead, anticipating his bounding off. As much as I’ve traveled with Novayans and found a kinship with them, it’s one of the things that reminds me we’re not the same. And that didn’t happen. R’Kesh looked up at the source of the sound, then looked back at me, still attentive. His eyelids narrowed briefly, and he averted his gaze again, which I understood to be Novayan politeness. \*\* I think Novayan balls should be fuzzy and round like cat balls. Novayan tails can latch onto a handhold in microgravity,leaving their hands free. I wrote this and then I realized, if this is what Novayan kits are like, do they even fit in anything resembling a classroom? The norm would be to just be raised on their homeworld, where they are usually in a family/village environment and getting tons and tons of outdoor physical activity young (physical stuff and hunting and singing are probably big focuses of the earliest education before they start loading the three Rs into their heads; that may actually come later in a young Novayan's education) what do we do with the kids offworld? Especially given Novayans bear litters? (edited) Val Renberg speaks about Novayans: “And there I was - with Novayans, who the instructor always had to go find and bring back into the class – perked as their ears and whiskers were for the slightest anything. And I do mean anything. The kits lashed their tails, and got up and paced from time to time. Young Novayans are either sleeping, or moving. They would do their part of the project and predictably, any Novayan would then be off again, wandering the halls or climbing in one of the rec rooms. Novayan kits could be annoying as hell, and it took a while before I found any Novayans at all any joy to share a classroom with. I usually took my project off into one of the spare resource rooms and worked on it by myself, and came back with my contribution. The important thing is that the class made room for all of us.” It may be that the age at which a Novayan is in Primary (basically going to be the equivalent of earliest grades) is actually older relative to a human and that their education is front loaded with the physical, emotional, social education per Novayan developmental standards, not human, and that raising a Novayan by human norms would actually damage them and create a Novayan who's not fit for Novayan society. (edited) Yeah, i was thinking that Novayans probably start school a bit later, but might learn faster But this makes sense for Novayans, they may physically develop pretty quickly and I think the culture may put more focus on combat skills (for discipline) early. It's important to learn to hold back - and to learn etiquette - because any Novayan, just by nature, is capable of just going into a single minded bloodlust and slaughtering people (and probably die doing it) just because of what they are. Because they bear litters of extremely inquisitive, ACTIVE children, who start learning to hunt young and who play really rough, a Novayan village will likely consist of a couple of actively breeding mothers, and a larger number of cut ear adults. Little Novayans just can... unleash unholy hell. Novayans are notorious for chugging gallons of coffee and stimulant drinks in space btw. Whatever their ears and whiskers pick up... they are on it, before even humans have detected the thing. They're already down the hall checking it out. It's not something Novayans are at all raised to discourage. It's a success mode. Having a fun time with the superstitious/spiritual nature of the Novayans. Feeling that R'Kesh went Wanderer because a Seer told him to, and felt that out there, with his life guided by the Stars Themselves, he would do something important that she foresaw. He met Val on the life quest that he took, and Val took on that quest for him. But I think there is a thing of, "you are who I was supposed to meet out here, in the black." He would not have known that Val would be taking on his life quest after his death, and completing it for him (and everyone who'd carried that same uncompleted quest over the centuries). But the Seer may have foreseen something. (edited) A Novayan's ears and whiskers twitch at something the humans around them don't hear or feel - and they're off. They're checking out Whatever-It-Is. They're already on it. It's also interesting to me to develop a culture for whom - well - their base survival needs are already somewhat baked in. A single Novayan left to themselves on some planet, could just go feral, as long as there's animal life there. So they built their culture around being more than that. Around their loves, their stories, their personal quests, their arts and knowledge ways, and attaining a personal best. Only possible with mastery of the Beast. (edited) Novayans have six nipples, tall pointed ears, long whiskers on their muzzle and eyebrows. Males have a retractile penis and that of intact males is covered in spines, though these may blunt and shorten over the time spent in space. R'Kesh and his brother K'Ratha at the point of writing belong to a lodge or brotherhood of other Wanderers; there are a couple of other human spacers in it, Val is brought in too, and lodges among Novayans can have the weight of syndicates. (Well, with the exception of big mega-syndicates like ItSyn.) Your other memberships will matter possibly in terms of politics/loyalties but being in a lodge is one of the options. Novayan tattoos - marks they have, cut (so fur doesn't grow back over the mark) and stained into the skin, indicate relationships to other Novayans (and Wanderers) over space and time, so: Say you have a Novayan who is out on a light run. (A chunk of them are Light Chasers. It's nothing to them. It isn't disruptive to their lives the way it is to a humans, because Novayan Wanderers often just leave the homeworld and never return.) They come back and a few generations have been born and raised since they were gone. Or - they're not Light Chasers, they've just been gone a damned long time. I like the image of "Light Chaser" in relation to a Novayan though because it sounds like they're chasing the red dot doesn't it. The Novayan returning, will be sung back into the lodge - it may be by descendants of those who sung him away. What knowledge (or whatever else) he brings with him will be brought into the lodge; if you make a promise as a Novayan you may be fulfilling it on the descendants of whomever you promised it to, or onto your lodge-kin down the road. It has implications for Val's taking R'Kesh's Life Quest, because she fulfills that then brings the knowledge he sought back to his lodge. Some years have passed, but it was a long term Life Quest that had probably been passed among various Novayans. Once one has been fulfilled, it's retired and not passed along anymore. The role of the Seer is pointed out here too because when R'Kesh went Wanderer, he would've had a Seer read him before going. (edited) Wanderer affiliation is diffuse and possibly decentralized (there are some Co-Op Spacer culture elements that filtered down from Novayan Wanderers), and Novayans outside of their own families may be wired to socialize individual-to-individual. Like, you can simply take up another individual's Life Quest, full stop. Val is not the first human to live among Novayans nor be accepted by some of them. And it doesn't make someone automatically a Novayan, though if they have tattoos (as she does) indicating having gone through some Novayan-specific cultural rituals in the proper way, it might establish more trust... about specific things... but the thing is, Novayan culture outside of their villages/clans, is individualist Novayans aren't being rescued by anyone; there is no Human Savior; Novayans didn't need saving, are fully agentic, have zero oppression history with humans (Nadiran might be another matter, to some degree, but nothing on the scale of chattel slavery or genocide), were a well established and semi successful population when humans showed up, and Novayans are possibly even more agentic than humans will ever be. If anything they deserve credit for saving our asses multiple times. (edited) Novayans spend long periods of time brushing/cleaning/grooming themselves, and each other. Tend to get lost in thought doing it. Novayan currency is hugely reputation. Novayans purr. Novayans probably don't use blankets. Be funny though if they like tightly packed nests. Just because I want an excuse for R'Kesh's brother to be found sleeping off a hangover in a box. I love the idea of the Novayan comfy room. They laze around in it, nest, curl up, groom each other, lie around like sybarites and drink and eat snacks. Ok, what if the nest is actually the central part of any Novayan community. Will be the central part of an all-Novayan ship, a village, a household, all kinds of other spaces. There is probably some etiquette about intruding on Novayans' nesting spaces. Being invited into one is basically... bonded pair, or family member Novayans lead so much with their feelings - their impulses - and being able to pair with someone who can be a grounding influence, two buddies or brothers or mates having each other's back, is the best for both of them. I haven't thought about the issue of someone who's used to eating the same predictable types of food day in and day out living on a ship, adjusting to different foods, but that's an issue anyway. Even traveling with Novayans wouldn't have been that weird, they eat food cubes and dried stuff too, they just tend more toward the keto side of it. But stuff is likely to get truly strange on Kybaria. The human Val’s chin tattoo is a mark of kinship between her, K'Ratha, and R'Kesh. The one down the right side of her face is from undertaking a life quest; if her body had been found then it would've been obvious to any Novayans that she had died carrying a Novayan's quest out, given enough context cues to show it's not fake. She has tattoos indicating how many generations of Co-Op spacer she is, some that basically echo some of her rating patches, some showing number of light runs, and a braided tribal looking wristband that echoes the Weave bracelet (basically indicating she was married.) Whatever else idk. The Co-Op CO symbol too because that becomes a plot point. Possibly some of the physical discipline stuff she might've learned from being married to a Novayan tom? The place this connects much later on, is that years after the humiliating situation at Rowantree, when she has the chance to take the credit jumping the wormhole, she lets the Novayans have that, that she did it specifically as Wanderer carrying out a dead Wanderer's work, and that this is shared with Captain Karrath (of the Novayan ship that brought her up to the wormhole, then met her on the other side 18 months later) and Karrath's family/crew. (edited) So basically if you're being chased by a pack of Novayans, huck a sack of battery powered mouse toys and strobe lights off to the side and saunter in the opposite direction. \* Novayans, my cat race. (They're going to come into game. I actually did a bit of worldbuilding and lore for them, I'll just say in the Trek game that they're a Caitian cousin, since we know nothing about Caitians. Meanwhile here's a semi fleshed out cat race.) so regarding that whole ass cat species... canonical to previous builds of the setting, before I replaced the Neoterrans with the Co-Op, the Novayans were already there, and the thing is, they are inherently individualistic. Like, it's baked in. Well, the males are anyway. D — 11/29/2021 10:07 AM I feel a ton of Novayans would've ended up spacers hugely because... well... they individually go out and seek more wandering range, it's a species thing. It's what they already do. They're probably not governable by traditional human systems of governance. Their own world just has enough room to roam. D — 11/29/2021 10:10 AM I kept Novayans this whole time mostly because in game, every group had one person who wanted to be a cat dude. D — 11/29/2021 10:18 AM But one thing that strikes me is that if Novayans were among the most heavily represented aliens on the Perimeter at the time that the Co-op began forming, they are probably among the aliens most represented in Co-op spacing. D — 11/29/2021 10:25 AM Funny fact in the original setting, "Novayan" comes from the original name of the human colony that was there in the original build of the setting, Novaya Moskva, which ultimately failed, but the planet remained titled "Novaya" and people totally forgot the original name. D — 11/29/2021 11:37 AM But that said, the rarity of encountering a Novayan female offworld makes it easier to deal with too. The Co-Op D — 11/29/2021 10:02 PM btw, the Novayans have a significant part in Co-op spacing. World Bible 1.0 D — 11/30/2021 4:25 PM People's religious beliefs will be what they are, and cultures' religious beliefs, and telepathy even exists, as well as some species things that seem woo woo (like the Myrmidons, Nadiran, Novayans), and possibly trippy consciousness shit, and plenty of stuff that's "indistinguishable from magic," and people may even draw strength from their beliefs in ways that matter. But there are no godlike aliens influencing anything. Godlike aliens/Space Jesus/Ancient Astronauts are a hard line I'm going to draw. (edited) aliens D — 11/30/2021 9:09 PM indeed, it would be. I'm not even sure they like the company of Novayans, who are furry and... often... probably smelly. D — 11/30/2021 9:10 PM It was amusing to realize that Novayans were probably the first alien culture whose members really took to Co-Op spacing. D — 11/30/2021 10:14 PM (Human and Novayan) future-slang D — 12/02/2021 9:03 PM May have come into the vernacular to humans via Novayan and Altikhari spacers, who had contact with unaligned/black market Nadiran clients in past years. D — 12/02/2021 9:46 PM I'll put the other stuff in the aliens channel, but here are the slurs: Myrmidons: bugs Nadiran: Naddies, Nads, Graymen, Vampires, Space Elves (Spelves?) Novayans: cats (questionably a slur? They seem to have a good sense of humor about it at least.) aliens D — 12/02/2021 9:56 PM Novayans: indigenous to a world of the Perimeter, Novayans were spacing (individually, usually with the black market until the Co-Op formed) along the Perimeter for a long time so there are probably a lot of Novayan culture quirks and terms that have migrated into spacer slang as well. They don't take themselves overly seriously and have a good sense of humor about being called "cats." Their individualism and tradition of solitary wandering to gain reputation and skill both suit them well to spacer life, and they've been at it in the region for generations longer than

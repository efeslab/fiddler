Here's my attempt at explaining why I think C is correct:

> The question asks us to determine which of the following must be true. So, in other words, which of the following MUST happen no matter what. Well, if we draw a square, and we draw a circle, we know that it's possible for a circle to be drawn that is both smaller than the square, the same size as the square, or larger than the square. So we know that A, B and E are wrong, because none of them must happen. That leaves us with C and D.

In order to protect the privacy of our clients, we are required to remove the names and other identifying information from their case files before we dispose of them. However, we are not required to remove such information from the index cards in the card catalogue that list the contents of the files, because the catalogue is kept in a restricted area. Which one of the following is the most accurate criticism of the reasoning presented above?

(A) It ignores the possibility that someone could consult the index cards in the card catalogue and then examine the case files to discover identifying information.
(B) It assumes that the only person who will consult the card catalogue is someone who has authorization to consult the case files.
(C) It assumes that the only people who will use the index cards in the card catalogue are people who have authorization to do so.
(D) It ignores the possibility that someone who is authorized to consult the case files might be able to discover identifying information that is not on the index cards.
(E) It assumes that the people who use the card catalogue are able to locate all the information that is on the index cards.

Answer is B, explanation of why:

The argument assumes that the only person who will consult the index cards in the card catalogue is someone who has authorization to consult the case files. But it is possible that an unauthorized person could consult the index cards and then examine the case files to discover identifying information. For instance, someone could gain access to the case files in a variety of ways. For example, a disgruntled employee who is authorized to consult the case files might copy identifying information and then sell it to a private detective.

The argument assumes that the only people who will use the index cards in the card catalogue are people who have authorization to do so. However, it is possible that an unauthorized person could consult the index cards and then examine the case files to discover identifying information. For instance, someone could gain access to the case files in a variety of ways. For example, a disgruntled employee who is authorized to consult the case files might copy identifying information and then sell it to a private detective.

(A) The argument does not ignore the possibility that someone could consult the index cards in the card catalogue and then examine the case files to discover identifying information; on the contrary, the argument explicitly allows for such a possibility.

Hi all, this is my first time posting here, and I am not sure if it is the correct forum to ask this question. I would like to build a system that automatically generates a Java source code. So far I have found JDT (Java Development Tools) in Eclipse, and JavaParser. Does anyone have any experience on which tool is better? Or are there other tools I could use? Many thanks!

I'm trying to write a plugin to generate JavaDoc for the current method being edited in Eclipse. In my handler I'm getting the CompilationUnit, AST, and method, then I'm getting the method's AST node. I'm passing the method node into a method that is supposed to generate the Javadoc and return the Javadoc as a String. I'm running into problems in my Javadoc generation method. I'm getting the AST node's children and looping through them, but I can't seem to find a way to get the values of the children. I've looked into JDT, ASTParser, and JavaParser. I've tried getting the AST Node's token value, and tried using a StringBuffer to add the tokens together. My Javadoc generation method: private static String getJavadoc(ASTNode node){ StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(); ASTNode parent = node.getParent(); ASTNode[] children = parent.getChildren(); for (int i = 0; i < children.length; i++){ ASTNode child = children[i]; // get the tokens of the child and add them to the buffer } return buffer.toString(); } I would like the method to return something like "/** * @return the ID of the method's parent */", but I can't seem to get the child node's tokens. Can anyone help me out?

INFO:root:0 output text: <s> Here's an LSAT question. Tell me the correct answer, explain why it is correct and why each of the other answers are wrong in simple terms.

A researcher is investigating a hypothesis which states that an organism X (which is not a virus) is the cause of a disease D in humans. He has observed that the organism X causes a disease D' in mice which is very similar to disease D in humans.

Which one of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the hypothesis?

(A) The organism X is not found in humans who have never had the disease D.
(B) The organism X causes disease D in humans, but only in humans who have been infected by another organism Y.
(C) The organism X can cause disease D in humans only when its genetic material has been altered.
(D) The organism X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but is also found in some humans who have never had the disease D.
(E) The organism X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but has not been found in humans who have had a disease other than D.

Show: :: OA

I will post the answer and explanations in 24 hours. Good luck!

Here's the OG explanation:

The question states that the researcher is investigating a hypothesis that the organism X is the cause of the disease D in humans. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the presence of X in humans is a sufficient condition for the presence of D in humans. In other words, if X is present, then D is also present. The correct answer must provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is also a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Answer choice (A): The organism X is not found in humans who have never had the disease D. This choice suggests that X is present in all humans who have had the disease D, but it is not sufficient to conclude that X is not found in humans who have never had the disease D. This choice may weaken the argument, but it does not provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Answer choice (B): The organism X causes disease D in humans, but only in humans who have been infected by another organism Y. This choice suggests that X is the cause of D in humans, but only in certain cases. It does not provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Answer choice (C): The organism X can cause disease D in humans only when its genetic material has been altered. This choice suggests that X is the cause of D in humans, but only in certain cases. It does not provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Answer choice (D): The organism X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but is also found in some humans who have never had the disease D. This choice suggests that X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but it is not sufficient to conclude that X is also found in humans who have never had the disease D. This choice may weaken the argument, but it does not provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Answer choice (E): The organism X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but has not been found in humans who have had a disease other than D. This choice suggests that X is found in humans who have had the disease D, but it is not sufficient to conclude that X has not been found in humans who have had a disease other than D. This choice may weaken the argument, but it does not provide evidence that the presence of X in humans is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

The correct answer is (A)

I thought that the correct answer was B, because of the word 'only'. The fact that the organism X causes disease D in humans, but only in humans who have been infected by another organism Y, strengthens the idea that the presence of X is a necessary condition for the presence of D in humans.

Can someone please explain to me why A is the correct answer?

Thanks!

It is often the most subtle, offhand, throwaway lines that can bring a whole story to life. They’re the lines that make us pause for a moment to think, “Did I just read that right?” They’re the lines that make us go back and read them again, just to make sure we understood.

They’re the lines that make us think, “Who wrote this?”

And in some cases, they’re the lines that make us go, “What?”.

So here are some of the best lines from books that make us think, “What?”

1.

“The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”

L.P. Hartley, The Go-Between

2.

“The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.”

Terry Pratchett, Diggers

3.

“There are three things in the world that deserve no mercy, hypocrisy, fraud, and tyranny.”

Frederick Douglass

4.

“There are no good girls gone wrong – just bad girls found out.”

Mae West

5.

“He was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher… or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.”

Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

6.

“It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.”

Mark Twain

7.

“If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth the writing.”

Benjamin Franklin

8.

“A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.”

Winston Churchill

9.

“A lie told often enough becomes the truth.”

Vladimir Lenin

10.

“A good marriage is the union of two good forgivers.”

Ruth Bell Graham

11.

“I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver.”

Maya Angelou

12.

“Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. Great works are performed not by strength, but perseverance.”

Samuel Johnson

13.

“Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.”

Isaac Asimov

14.

“A lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.”

Joseph Goebbels

15.

“It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”

Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities

16.

“Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”

John F. Kennedy

17.

“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt

18.

“I am an invisible man. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids – and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have

What are the best lines from books that make you think, “What?”

1. “I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids – and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” – Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man

2. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its no

Stimulus: NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to keep a pair of live rats in a cage in her apartment for three weeks. NAME_1 has a rat phobia, which is a persistent, irrational fear of rats. She is not concerned that her phobia will interfere with her ability to perform the experiment, but she is concerned that having to keep the rats in her apartment will significantly increase her anxiety level. NAME_2, a friend of NAME_1’s, has offered to keep the rats in her apartment. The apartment is only two blocks from NAME_1’s, and NAME_2 is willing to make the round-trip walk twice a day to feed and care for the rats. NAME_1, however, is hesitant to accept NAME_2’s offer, because NAME_1 believes that keeping the rats in NAME_2’s apartment would constitute unethical conduct on the part of both of them. Which of the following, if true, provides the best justification for NAME_1’s belief? A) The experiment has been approved by the university’s institutional review board, which has the responsibility to ensure that all experiments comply with ethical standards

There is a related problem in the domain of software security. Namely, in security-critical programs, there is the problem of identifying and protecting secrets. A secret is a string which is generated at random, e.g. a cryptographic key. The problem is that sometimes a secret can leak through a public output of the program.

The way to do this is to read the paper "A Simple Method for Constructing Cryptographically Strong Pseudorandom Permutations from Pseudorandom Functions" by Black and Rogaway. The key to their construction is the Feistel construction, which is easy to paraphrase.

What you need to show is that the Feistel construction is a permutation if the function used in the construction is a permutation. This is a theorem in the Black and Rogaway paper, so you will need to paraphrase this theorem.

The paper also contains a proof of the Feistel construction's security, but you should not need to understand this proof to answer the question.

I am looking for someone who is a specialist in cryptography, I have a question related to cryptography, if you can help me with this, I'll pay.

I am working on my master's thesis on the subject of Cryptography. I am interested in the problem of the invertibility of a function on the finite field. I was hoping to get some insight and help.

The problem I am working on is as follows:

We have a function f : F_p -> F_p where F_p is the finite field of order p. I would like to know if there is a function g : F_p -> F_p such that g(f(x)) = x for all x in F_p.

I have been able to prove that such a function exists for some values of p, but I have not been able to prove it for all values of p. I have been able to show that such a function exists for p = 2, 3, 5, and 7, but I have not been able to show it for p = 11, 13, 17, or 19.

I would appreciate any help or insight you can provide.

I’ve written several times about the issue of “cancel culture” — the tendency to punish public figures (often, though not exclusively, celebrities and media figures) for saying or doing something that’s perceived as bigoted or morally reprehensible.

It’s the latter two examples that Smith discusses in his article, and while he’s sympathetic to the people who felt offended by these instances, his focus is on the broader problem of a media environment in which anyone, from a YouTube personality to a presidential candidate, can be “cancelled”: In the past, public figures could count on their fans to forgive them for a bad joke, or an ill-advised remark, or a youthful mistake, or a personal failing. It’s hard to think of a YouTube personality who has been more scrutinized and more canceled than PewDiePie.

He said he has had to learn to not “take everything too seriously”, because “it is so easy to get upset about something people say”. In his statement, he said: "I'm sorry for the words I used, as I know they were hurtful.

His latest video addresses his use of the n-word, while playing a game of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. However, they would like to think about it for a while and will take a few days off to think about their future on YouTube.

On Wednesday morning, he posted a video titled “My Response” that opened with an apology. I know my response was inappropriate and insensitive, and I genuinely apologise.”.

> 1. What is the answer to the question?
> 2. Please explain why it is correct and why the other answers are wrong.

So... the answer is: 1, 3, and 4.

I would have to say that 2 and 5 are wrong because of the following:

(2) No. NAME_1 should not kill the dog when her classmates are willing to do it for her.

This answer implies that NAME_1 should not kill the dog if someone else is willing to do it for her.

But, since the stem reads "NAME_1 has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to kill a dog." it implies that NAME_1 has been given a specific assignment and it would be required of her to kill the dog, otherwise, she would not pass the class. So, since NAME_1 is a vegetarian, she has no choice but to kill the dog, in order to pass the class.

(5) No. NAME_1 should not kill the dog when she has not yet considered all of the alternatives to killing the dog.

This answer implies that NAME_1 should consider all of the alternatives to killing the dog before she kills the dog. This would be acceptable if the stem read:

NAME_1 has been given an assignment to kill a dog.

But, in the stem, it reads:

NAME_1 has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to kill a dog.

This implies that NAME_1 has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that requires her to kill a dog, not that NAME_1 has been given an assignment to kill a dog. There is a difference.

In addition, the first statement reads:

(A) Since NAME_1 is a vegetarian, she is strongly opposed to killing animals for the purpose of conducting experiments.

Which implies that NAME_1 is opposed to killing animals for the purpose of conducting experiments.

So, the answer is:

(1) Yes. The experiment is important, and NAME_1 is the best qualified to complete it.

(3) No. NAME_1 should not kill the dog when her classmates are willing to do it for her.

(4) Yes. Killing

Hi,

This code is not syntactically correct in JDK 11.

For example, if you have the following:

```
import static java.lang.System.out;
```

and later you have

```
out.println("Hello World");
```

Then this cannot be renamed to a variable name as `System.out` is a static variable and cannot be renamed.

Thanks,
- Siddhartha Chatterjee commented

Hi,

I'm still unable to make the rename feature work.

I have a class named `A` that has a method `test()`.

Now, when I click on `A` and do `Rename...`, I expect to see all the usages of `A` to be renamed to the new name. But instead, I see that `A` is renamed to the new name only in the declaration of the `A` class.

The usage of `A` in the `test()` method still shows `A` as `A`.

I would expect the code to be changed as follows:

Before:

```
public class A {
    public void test() {
        // Some code
    }
}
```

After:

```
public class B {
    public void test() {
        // Some code
    }
}
```

I would expect to see this change if I rename `A` to `B`.

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm still unable to rename identifiers in Java.

Can you please advise?

Hi,

Can we get an update on this?

Thanks,

P.S.: I'm unable to rename any identifier in Java.

I have the following code:

```
public class A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

When I try to rename `A` to `B`, only the class declaration is changed.

The usage of `A` in the `main()` method does not get changed.

Is there a way to fix this?

Thanks,

P.S.: Also, can we get an update on the "Additional parameters" feature? I still see a lot of issues with the Java language support, so I think it will be a while before it's ready for prime time.

She has two older sisters, Park Soo-nyeon and Park Yoo-jin. It was revealed that 2NE1’s former member, Sandara Park and Park Bom, and their father have filed an injunction against malicious comments and rumors.

Park was a trainee for four years, learning about dance, singing, and acting from the YG Entertainment staff. Park Bom, Sandara Park, and CL are not in close contact, according to a new report.

# 2 Answers

C: her knowledge of canine physiology will be of no use in her future career as a veterinarian.

Because:

E) it would be wrong for her to subject the dog to pain.

is wrong.

It is the experiment which is causing the pain.

The only way to avoid causing pain, is not to do the experiment, and that would be counter productive.

In order to get better in the future, you must learn from the past.

I don't understand why the first answer is not correct. It is obviously "A) anesthetized dogs are capable of experiencing pain."

Stimulus: NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to take a healthy, anesthetized dog and subject it to a drastic blood loss in order to observe the physiological consequences of shock. The dog would neither regain consciousness nor survive the experiment. NAME_1 decides not to do this assignment. Question: NAME_1’s decision most closely accords with which one of the following principles? Answers: A. All other things being equal, gratuitously causing any animal to suffer pain is unjustified. B. Taking the life of an animal is not justifiable unless doing so would immediately assist in saving several animal lives or in protecting the health of a person. C. The only sufficient justification for experimenting on animals is that future animal suffering is thereby prevented. D. Practicing veterinarians have a professional obligation to strive to prevent the unnecessary death of an animal except in cases of severely ill or injured animals whose prospects for recovery are dim. E. No one is ever justified in acting with the sole intention of causing the death of a living thing, be it animal or human."]

2008-06-09 [kittykittykitty]: I don't know why they'd want to know the right answer if they already know it. I guess just to be sure they know it, so they can tell us the right answer if we get it wrong. ;)

2008-06-09 [kittykittykitty]: If they already knew the right answer, then why would they ask the question? I don't get it. I think I might be slow today. ;)

2008-06-10 [kittykittykitty]: I'm so confused. I'm not understanding the purpose of a test if they already know the answers. This doesn't make sense to me. Do you really think they don't know the right answer? I thought the whole point of a test was to see if we know the answer.

2008-06-10 [kittykittykitty]: I can see the point of the question. I just don't see the point of asking it, if they already know the right answer. I don't get the purpose of the test, if they already know the answers. Why ask the question? Just to make us learn it? If we don't get it right, then they tell us the answer?

2008-06-10 [Paul Doyle]: the purpose of the test is not to learn if we know the right answer, but to learn if we know the right answer for the right reasons.

if we guess the right answer for the wrong reason, then we can't be sure that we really know it.

it is the same principle as that of "learning" things for a test. i've known a lot of people who have learned things for a test and then forgotten them afterwards.

Article: "Name_1 and Name_2: A Friendship Forged on a Trip to Ukraine" By Mary Smith Name_1 and Name_2 have been friends for years, but it wasn't until they went on a trip to Ukraine together that their friendship truly blossomed. The two had been acquaintances in college, but it wasn't until they both ended up in the same graduate program that they began to form a closer bond. They would often grab lunch together or study in the library, and their shared interests in literature and history led to many lively discussions. However, it wasn't until Name_1 invited Name_2 on a trip to Ukraine with a group of friends that their friendship really took off. Name_1 had always wanted to visit the country, and when he mentioned the idea to Name_2, she was immediately interested. They spent months planning the trip, discussing the logistics and researching the best places to visit. Finally, the day of the trip arrived, and the group set off for Ukraine. They spent two weeks exploring the country, visiting historic sites, sampling local cuisine, and taking in the stunning scenery.

They bonded over their shared love of travel and adventure, and their friendship grew stronger with each passing day. By the end of the trip, Name_1 and Name_2 were closer than ever, and their friendship has continued to flourish ever since.

## What are the 3 types of makeup?

There are three major types of cosmetic makeup: corrective makeup, which enhances or minimizes facial features; fantasy makeup, which is used to make people look unnatural, like aliens or animals; and camouflage makeup, which is used to cover skin flaws like acne or tattoos.

## What is the difference between everyday and special occasion makeup?

Everyday Makeup is lightweight and should be quick and easy to apply. Special occasion makeup is heavier and should look flawless!

## What is the difference between natural makeup and professional makeup?

Professional makeup is heavier, thicker, and has a higher payoff than regular makeup. Regular makeup is designed to be worn all day and all night. Professional makeup is designed to be worn for a couple of hours.

## What is the difference between regular makeup and HD makeup?

High definition makeup is formulated with higher levels of silica and dimethicone to minimize the appearance of fine lines and pores in HD. These ingredients act as “fillers” to smooth over the skin and prevent light from reflecting off imperfections.

## What makeup does the average person wear?

A recent study has shown that the average woman spends $43 a month on makeup. That’s $516 a year and over $20,000 in a lifetime. In a poll of 2,000 women, a quarter admitted that they have no idea how much they spend on their cosmetics.

## What is the difference between regular makeup and stage makeup?

Stage makeup uses bold colors. The lights of the stage can wash out your features, so your makeup has to be more vivid than usual. Everyday makeup is designed to make you look more natural.

## How much makeup do you need for a party?

You can always add more later, but it’s always better to start with less and add more as needed. If you’re going to a casual party, you probably won’t need as much makeup as you would for a formal event. Start with a light foundation and concealer, and then add some blush and mascara.

## What is the difference between glam makeup and natural makeup?

Glam makeup is all about

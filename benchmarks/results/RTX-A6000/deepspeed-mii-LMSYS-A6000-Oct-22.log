A new study shows that people with high IQs are more likely to be night owls. The study, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, found that people who score higher on IQ tests tend to be more nocturnal.

The researchers analyzed data from a large online survey of over 10,000 people from around the world. They found that those who identified as “owls” were more likely to have higher IQs than those who identified as “larks” (people who are more active in the morning).

The researchers say that the findings could have implications for workplace productivity. They suggest that employers might want to consider allowing employees to work later in the day if they are high achievers.

A man is walking on the beach. As he walks, he sees a bottle, picks it up, and opens it. There is a genie inside. The genie says to the man "I will grant you one wish." The man thinks for a moment and says, "I wish for all of the world's water to become undrinkable, except for the water I own." The genie grants the wish, and the man continues walking along the beach. Soon he comes across a man who is drowning in the ocean. The man who made the wish says to the drowning man, "You better swim." Why did the man who made the wish say that?

a. The man who made the wish is not a very nice man.
b. The man who made the wish is a very funny man.
c. The man who made the wish is a very smart man.
d. The man who made the wish is a very stupid man.
e. The man who made the wish is a very evil man.

Correct answer:
d. The man who made the wish is a very stupid man.

Explanation:
A very smart man would realize that he could only wish for his water to become drinkable, not for all the world's water to become undrinkable.

A very evil man would know he was going to have to drink his own water, but would not care that he would be the only person in the world who could. He would not have wished to make all the world's water undrinkable in the first place.

A very funny man would wish for something like for all the world's water to turn into wine.

A very nice man would not wish for all the world's water to become undrinkable.

A very stupid man would not realize that his water would become undrinkable along with all the world's water.

INFO:root:0 output text: <s> Here's an LSAT question. Tell me the correct answer, explain why it is correct and why each of the other answers are wrong in simple, everyday English.

> This question is a Logical Reasoning question. You will have 35 minutes to answer 25 questions.

1. The following appears as part of an argument in a letter to the editor of a major newspaper:

> "The United States can learn much from the European Union's decision to place restrictions on the sale of cigarettes. The United States should follow the European Union's lead by increasing the tax on cigarettes."

Which one of the following arguments most closely conforms to the principle illustrated by the argument above?

(A) The United States should follow the lead of Great Britain, which has outlawed the practice of fox hunting.
(B) The United States should follow the lead of China, which has recently reduced its consumption of tobacco.
(C) The United States should follow the lead of Germany, which has recently increased its production of hybrid vehicles.
(D) The United States should follow the lead of Canada, which has recently decreased its imports of oil.
(E) The United States should follow the lead of France, which has recently reduced its tax on imported automobiles.

Here's my answer. You tell me how I did and explain why it's right or wrong.

A. This question is really easy to answer. All you have to do is find the answer that mentions a restriction on something. Only Answer A does that. Answer B doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in consumption. Answer C doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions an increase in production. Answer D doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in imports. Answer E doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in taxes. Thus, Answer A is correct.

A. Answer A is the only one that mentions a restriction on something. Answer B doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in consumption. Answer C doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions an increase in production. Answer D doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in imports. Answer E doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in taxes.

B. This is a simple matching question. The stimulus talks about restricting cigarettes. So, we're looking for an answer choice that talks about restricting something. Only Answer A does that. Answer B doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in consumption. Answer C doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions an increase in production. Answer D doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in imports. Answer E doesn't mention a restriction; it mentions a decrease in taxes. Thus, Answer A is correct.

C. The stimulus suggests that the U.S. should follow the E.U.'s lead in restricting cigarette sales. So, the answer will have to suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country. Answer A says the U.S. should follow the lead of Great Britain. Answer B doesn't suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country; it just says the U.S. should follow the E.U.'s lead in restricting cigarette sales. Answer C doesn't suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country; it says the U.S. should follow the lead of Germany in increasing hybrid vehicle production. Answer D doesn't suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country; it says the U.S. should follow the lead of Canada in decreasing oil imports. Answer E doesn't suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country; it says the U.S. should follow the lead of France in decreasing taxes on imported automobiles.

D. The stimulus suggests that the U.S. should follow the E.U.'s lead in restricting cigarette sales. So, the answer will have to suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country. Answer A says the U.S. should follow the lead of Great Britain. Answer B doesn't suggest that the U.S. should follow the lead of another country; it just says the U.S. should follow the E.U.'s lead in restricting cigarette sales.

If you need to generate a variable name, feel free to pick any name that is not in the given code, e.g. "z" would be OK. Please make sure your tool can generate paraphrases for other code snippets as well. There is no need to change the layout of the code. We do not want to see a tool that generates code with a lot of unnecessary white space or other layout details. Please also make sure the generated code is valid and compiles correctly. In this particular example, the following generated code would be acceptable: static boolean[] sieve(int max) { boolean[] prime = new boolean[max + 1]; int root = (int) Math.sqrt(max); for (int i = 2; i < root; i++) { if (!prime[i]) { int j; for (j = 2; j < max; j += i) { prime[j] = true; } } } return prime; } For the given code, a tool that generates the following code would be incorrect: static boolean[] sieve(int max) { boolean[] primes = new boolean[max + 1]; int root = (int) Math.sqrt(max); for (int i = 2; i < root; i++) { if (!primes[i]) { int j; for (j = 2; j < max; j += i) { primes[j] = true; } } } return primes; } For this particular code, the issue is the renamed variable name in the return statement. Note that you will need to rename the identifiers in the correct order, otherwise the paraphrased code would not be syntactically correct, e.g. the following is incorrect: static boolean[] sieve(int max) { boolean[] prime = new boolean[max + 1]; int root = (int) Math.sqrt(max); for (int i = 2; i < root; i++) { if (!prime[i]) { int j; for (j = 2; j < max; j += i) { primes[j] = true; } } } return prime; } The issue in this case is that we renamed the identifier "prime" in the return statement to "primes". Note that we have intentionally left the variable names in the given code as such so that your tool will not accidentally change the original variable names. In other words, you should not take this as a hint to rename any of the variable names in the given code. We do not want you to rename any identifiers in the given code in your paraphrased code. It is also important to note that the generated code should be equivalent to the given code in terms of execution behavior. You should not change the control flow of the given code. In the case of this particular example, the generated code should behave exactly the same as the given code. You should not introduce or remove any side effects. For example, your tool should not introduce new print statements to print the value of any of the variables. Your tool should not change the data type of any of the identifiers either. For example, your tool should not change the data type of the return type of the method. Note that the generated code must also compile and run correctly. For example, the following code would be incorrect: static boolean[] sieve(int max) { boolean prime = new boolean[max + 1]; int root = (int) Math.sqrt(max); for (int i = 2; i < root; i++) { if (!prime[i]) { int j; for (j = 2; j < max; j += i) { prime[j] = true; } } } return prime; } The issue in this case is that the variable prime is a boolean value, not an array. It is not an array, so we cannot use the array operator "[]" on it. Another example of incorrect code would be the following: static boolean[] sieve(int max) { boolean[] prime = new boolean[max + 1]; int root = (int) Math.sqrt(max); for (int i = 2; i < root; i++) { if (!prime[i]) { int j; for (j = 2; j < max; j += i

## The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.

This is a question I get asked a lot. And it's a question I've struggled with for years. But recently, I've had a bit of a breakthrough. I've finally realized that there's no one answer to this question. Every single person has a different definition of what makes something beautiful. For some, it's a sunset. For others, it's a painting. And for others, it's a person. What matters most is that you find something that makes you feel beautiful. Something that makes you feel happy, and loved, and alive.

## "The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." -Helen Keller

There's no denying that Helen Keller was a remarkable woman. Born in 1880, she became deaf and blind at the age of 19 months old, but that didn't stop her from living an extraordinary life. Despite her disabilities, she was able to learn how to communicate using sign language and became an advocate for the deaf and blind community. In addition to her work with the deaf and blind, Keller was also an author, lecturer, and political activist. She was the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Radcliffe College and was also the first deaf-blind person to be inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Her life and work have inspired countless people over the years, and her words continue to resonate with us today. Keller once said, "The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." This quote is a reminder that the things that truly matter in life are not always tangible. Sometimes, the most beautiful things are those that we cannot see or touch, but can only feel in our hearts. This is a reminder to focus on the things that truly matter, and to never take the beauty of the world for granted.

## "Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart." -Kahlil Gibran

There are many different definitions of beauty, but the one that I think is the most beautiful is the one that Kahlil Gibran wrote about in his book, "The Prophet." In it, he says, "Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart." I think this is the most beautiful definition of beauty because it is not superficial. It is not about how someone looks on the outside, but rather, it is about how they feel on the inside. It is about having a light in your heart that shines through and makes you beautiful, no matter what you look like on the outside.

## "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." -Helen Keller

One of the most famous quotes about beauty is by Helen Keller. She said, "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." I believe that this quote is so true. The most beautiful things in life cannot be seen with the eyes. They must be felt with the heart. This is why I think that love is the most beautiful thing in the world. It cannot be seen or touched, but it can be felt with the heart. Love is the most beautiful thing in the world because it is the most powerful thing in the world. It can move mountains and change the world. It is the most important thing in the world.

## "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

There's no denying that beauty is subjective. What one person finds beautiful, another might not. But that doesn't mean that beauty is any less real or meaningful. In fact, it can be argued that the fact that beauty is in the eye of the beholder makes it all the more special. After all, what's more beautiful than something that is uniquely appreciated by each individual? So next time you find yourself admiring something or someone, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And that means that you are just as beautiful as the object of your admiration.

Stimulus: NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to conduct a number of tests on various live animals, including mice and rabbits. However, NAME_1 is a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and she believes that animal research is both cruel and immoral. If she were to conduct the research, she would not only be acting against her conscience, but would also be acting in violation of the society's strict policy against its members taking part in any research that involves living animals.

I got E for the answer, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. I think E is correct because she would be doing an experiment on herself, so she would not have to worry about hurting any animals. I think A is wrong because dropping out of veterinary school is too drastic of a measure. I think B is wrong because dropping the course in which the experiment is required would be

Stimulus: NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to perform surgery on rats. She has never before performed any type of surgery on a mammal, and therefore is not sure that she has the skills necessary to successfully complete the experiment. NAME_2, a graduate teaching assistant in veterinary medicine, advises her to use anesthetics in her experiment to ensure that her results are valid.

NAME_2 assures her that anesthetics will eliminate the rats' consciousness, making the surgery itself akin to performing the surgery on a human patient who is unconscious, and that any remaining pain or discomfort can be minimized through careful post-operative care. Answer choices: (A) Since NAME_2 has the credentials to advise NAME_1, NAME_1 should follow her advice. (B) Since NAME_1 has never before performed any type of surgery on a mammal, she should accept NAME_2's advice to use anesthetics in her experiment.

Sieve of Eratosthenes

The sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e. not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so). Larger primes up to around 10 billion can be found with more advanced, but more complicated algorithms. However, the Sieve of Atkin is a more efficient algorithm for larger numbers.

The first known written reference to the sieve is in Nicomachus's Introduction to Arithmetic, dated to the 1st century AD. In the 4th century AD, the sieve gets its name from the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene. The pseudocode presented here is an implementation of this algorithm.

Taeyong and the rest of NCT 127 will be kicking off their tour on November 2nd at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.

NCT 127 has been one of the most active K-Pop boy groups in the US.

“I’m very excited to be able to meet all of you.

We will do our best to make sure that you all can have a lot of fun,” said Taeyong.

NCT 127, which stands for “Neo Culture Technology”, is a South Korean boy group formed by SM Entertainment.

The group is currently made up of 10 members: Taeil, Johnny, Taeyong, Yuta, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Winwin, Jungwoo, Mark, and Haechan.

The group is split into multiple subunits that are based in different parts of the world, allowing the group to promote their music in multiple regions.

The original NCT subunit, NCT 127, has members from South Korea, Japan, and China.

NCT 127’s upcoming tour will hit 19 cities across the US and Canada, including Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Vancouver.

This will be the group’s first arena tour in North America.

While they are in the US, NCT 127 will also be appearing at i Heart Radio’s Jingle Ball on December 6th.

The group is known for their hip-hop, rap, and dance music.

NCT 127 has been active in the US since 2018.

In April, the group made history when they became the first K-Pop act to perform on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

Satyameva Jayate - Truth alone triumphs.

I have explained the answers, if you still have any doubt you can write.

Stimulus: NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to dissect a live animal. NAME_2, an animal rights advocate, has asked NAME_1 not to perform the experiment, arguing that it is wrong to use living animals for any purpose. NAME_1's reply is that it is more important to expand the field of veterinary medicine than to avoid pain to an animal. NAME_2's argument is that NAME_1's experiment is unacceptable. The conclusion of NAME_2's argument is that NAME_1's experiment is unacceptable. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken NAME_2's argument?

(A) The field of veterinary medicine has made great strides in recent years, but more strides are needed.

It is not relevant as it will not weaken the argument. The conclusion of NAME_2 is that NAME_1's experiment is unacceptable. NAME_2 thinks it is unacceptable even if it makes great strides in veterinary medicine. So, the argument of NAME_2 is not affected.

(B) NAME_1's experiment would not result in great pain to the animal.

The answer is B. This option will weaken the argument of NAME_2. NAME_2 is arguing that the experiment is unacceptable. If the experiment does not result in great pain to the animal then it will weaken the argument of NAME_2.

(C) NAME_1's experiment would not significantly expand the field of veterinary medicine.

This option will not affect the argument of NAME_2. NAME_2 is arguing that the experiment is unacceptable. Even if the experiment does not significantly expand the field of veterinary medicine, NAME_2 will argue that it is unacceptable.

(D) NAME_2 has a strong desire to see the field of veterinary medicine expand.

It is not relevant as it will not weaken the argument. The conclusion of NAME_2 is that NAME_1's experiment is unacceptable. NAME_2 thinks it is unacceptable even

The solution must be syntactically correct and compile without errors. The solution must compile with no warnings (e.g. javac -Xlint:all -Werror). The solution must not contain any TODO comments. The solution must be formatted properly. (You may use an automated formatter.) Your submission will be automatically tested by our automatic grader. Your program must print the number of the test case, followed by a space, and then the result of the sieve. For example: 1 [false, false, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true

The above tweets are all real tweets about Lady Gaga by the same person. You’ll probably notice that they’re all extremely positive, but they’re all talking about different things. They’re all talking about Lady Gaga, but one is about her face, one is about her style, and one is about how her critics feel about her.

We’ve all seen people go on wild Twitter rants, either in support or in criticism of a person or a thing, and those rants tend to be long, and they tend to have different tweets that are all talking about the same person, but in slightly different ways. We don’t usually notice it, but those tweets all have the same person’s Twitter handle, and the same hashtag.

We can call that a “topic cluster”.

In machine learning, topic clusters are sets of text documents that are all about the same topic. This is different from a “document cluster”, where a set of documents is clust

The dog would neither regain consciousness nor survive the experiment. NAME_1 decides not to do this assignment. Question: NAME_1’s decision most nearly reflects which of the following principles? (A) People who use animals for scientific or medical purposes ought to cause them as little pain as possible. (B) It is acceptable to experiment on animals as long as the experiment is intended to further human welfare. (C) It is acceptable to experiment on animals as long as the experiment has a chance of saving a human life. (D) It is morally wrong to experiment on a healthy animal. (E) The morality of experimenting on an animal is determined by the effect of the experiment on the animal. I got it wrong. The answer is B, and here is how the LSAT explains it: People who use animals for scientific or medical purposes ought to cause them as little pain as possible. This principle is too broad in scope to be reflected in NAME_1’s decision, since it would cover such things as experiments in which animals are merely observed rather than harmed. It is acceptable to experiment on animals as long as the experiment is intended to further human welfare. NAME_1’s decision can be taken to reflect this principle, since her concern in making her decision is apparently that the experiment would not save a human life and so would not further human welfare. It is acceptable to experiment on animals as long as the experiment has a chance of saving a human life. This principle is too narrow in scope to be reflected in NAME_1’s decision. It is morally wrong to experiment on a healthy animal. NAME_1’s decision is not a reflection of this principle, since she may well approve of experimenting on animals as long as their health is not impaired. The morality of experimenting on an animal is determined by the effect of the experiment on the animal. NAME_1’s decision does not reflect this principle, since she is concerned with the effect on the animal only to the extent that it reflects the experiment’s effect on human welfare. This one just feels wrong to me, so I think I understand how I got it wrong, but I still don't understand how the correct answer is right. Can someone explain this to me? Thanks.

[Edited by GG on Jan 02, 2018]

GG, there are three wrong answers here and only one right answer.

The wrong answers are

1) too broad in scope
2) too narrow in scope
3) doesn't reflect her decision.

After discussing the logistics of the trip, NAME_2 agrees to consider the invitation and give an answer. 3. NAME_2 sends NAME_1 a calendar invitation for the trip to Ukraine. 4. In February, NAME_1 is unable to attend the trip, but NAME_2 is unable to cancel plans to visit family. 5. NAME_2 decides not to cancel the trip to Ukraine because it is too late. 6. NAME_1 is disappointed that NAME_2 went on the trip without them. 7. In April, NAME_1 and NAME_2 discuss the trip to Ukraine and NAME_2 apologizes for not inviting NAME_1. 8. NAME_1 forgives NAME_2 and they both agree to have a better relationship in the future.

## Explanation

There are several inconsistencies between the summary and the article. Firstly, the summary states that NAME_2 agreed to consider the invitation, but the article suggests that they may have been uncertain or hesitant. Additionally, the summary indicates that NAME_2 sent a calendar invitation for the trip to Ukraine, but the article states that the invitation was sent via text message. Furthermore, the summary suggests that NAME_1 was disappointed that NAME_2 went on the trip without them, but the article implies that they were upset that NAME_2 had not cancelled the trip. Finally, the summary states that NAME_1 forgave NAME_2, but the article suggests that they were still frustrated with their friend.

## Conclusion

Given the article above, the summary is not factually consistent with the article. There are several inconsistencies between the two, including the method of invitation, the reasons for NAME_1's disappointment, and the resolution of the conflict between the two friends. As such, the summary should be rewritten to better reflect the content of the article.

A person is going to say, I don’t want to be here in the first place and then they go on to say, I’m going to do something that’s going to get everyone upset. The only thing that makes sense is that the person is trying to get a rise out of everyone.

I know I’m a little bit of a weirdo.

You’re right. I dont want to be here in the first place. I’m going to do something that’s going to get everyone upset.

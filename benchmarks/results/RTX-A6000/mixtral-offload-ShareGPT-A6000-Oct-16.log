It also is a confrontation between the old and the new, between two generations, and between two very different ways of thinking about the world.

Papa Min was a pioneer in the meat industry and helped develop a lot of the standards that are still in place today. But he doesn't feel the need to change with the times. He still thinks a company should be run the old-fashioned way. He is not about to change his company name or anything about the company itself. He doesn't want to have to take his hat off when he goes into a fancy restaurant. In other words, he's an old-fashioned man.

Min is much more modern and progressive. He is willing to update the company and change its image. He doesn't mind taking his hat off when he goes into a fancy restaurant. In fact, he likes to take it off and sit at the bar and talk to people. Papa Min doesn't like this, and he is disgusted by his son. He has worked hard all his life to build up the company and to make it the best it could be. Now Min is trying to destroy everything he has worked for.

In this scene we see the conflict between tradition and modernity. We see how two generations of men can have very different perspectives on the world.

INFO:root:0 output text: <s> Certainly, here is a table outlining the risks to both the Builder and the Owner associated with each subclause of Clause 11:

It’s worth noting that the risks to the Builder are generally higher than the risks to the Owner, as the Builder is responsible for ensuring that the work is completed to a high standard and within the agreed timeframe and budget. The Owner, on the other hand, may be more concerned with ensuring that the Builder is following the plans and specifications and that the work is being completed to their satisfaction.

In summary, the Builder and Owner both have risks to manage during the construction process, and it’s important for both parties to communicate openly and work together to ensure a successful outcome.

## How to mitigate the risks

There are several strategies that the Builder and Owner can use to mitigate the risks associated with Clause 11 of the HIA Building Contract:

- Clear and comprehensive contracts: Both parties should ensure that the contract is clear and comprehensive, and that all details related to the project are clearly outlined in the contract. This will help to minimize the risk of misunderstandings and disputes.
- Regular communication: The Builder and Owner should communicate regularly throughout the project to ensure that both parties are aware of any changes or issues that arise. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that any issues can be addressed quickly.
- Quality control measures: The Builder should implement quality control measures to ensure that the work is being completed to a high standard. This may include regular inspections, quality assurance checks, and the use of qualified and experienced subcontractors.
- Proper planning and scheduling: The Builder should ensure that the project is properly planned and scheduled, with contingencies in place to deal with any unexpected delays or issues. This will help to minimize the risk of delays and cost overruns.
- Insurance coverage: Both the Builder and Owner should ensure that they have appropriate insurance coverage in place to protect themselves against any risks associated with the project.

By taking these steps, the Builder and Owner can help to minimize the risks associated with Clause 11 of the HIA Building Contract and ensure a successful outcome for the project.

## Legal advice

It’s always a good idea to seek legal advice before signing any contract, including the HIA Building Contract. A lawyer can review the contract and advise you on any legal issues or concerns that you may have.

The three sit down to talk and eat deli meat, and Papa Min tells them about his passion for deli meat and how he built his company from nothing, but Ruby thinks that Papa Min is only talking to her because she's famous. She feels Papa Min's story of hard work and dedication is hollow and that he's not a good father.

The reader is meant to see Papa Min as a capitalist who has lost his connection to human nature. Ruby and Min, however, feel differently. Papa Min loves deli meat. His passion has allowed him to build an empire. He has used the deli meat industry to make millions. While Ruby and Min don't agree with Papa Min's methods, they can respect his work ethic.

On the other hand, the reader is meant to see Ruby as the hero, the one who is fighting back against the capitalists. Ruby is the only one who seems to have an understanding of the injustices of Papa Min's empire. She's the only one who can see that Papa Min's life is one that has been hollowed out, leaving him with nothing but a bottomless desire for more money and power. While Min feels like he's the one who has to stand up to Papa Min, he's too blinded by his own sense of entitlement to see the real problem.

The final scene of Ruby Safeway is the moment when Ruby, the hero, finally decides to fight back. She realizes that Papa Min has no idea what he's doing, and that he's just an empty vessel. She's finally able to see Papa Min for what he truly is: a corporate overlord who doesn't understand the power of passion.

In the final scene of the movie, Ruby Safeway (played by Milla Jovovich) is at her lowest point. She is in a hospital bed, with tubes and machines hooked up to her. Her husband, Nick (played by Jason Isaacs), is sitting by her side, but she is unresponsive. Nick is distraught, and he is pleading with her to wake up.

Finally, Ruby's eyes open and she looks at Nick. She tells him that she is ready to go. She asks Nick to help her get up, and he helps her out of bed. They walk outside, and Ruby sees a bright light in the distance. She tells Nick that she is going to walk towards the light.

As they walk, Ruby becomes more and more energ

The Catalog Service provides a centralized repository for storing and managing product data, while the Inventory Service provides real-time information on inventory levels and availability. The system also includes a trading management component that enables businesses to track and manage orders, invoices, and payments.

One of the key benefits of the Catalog Inventory Trading Management System is its use of .NET, which provides a robust and secure platform for developing enterprise-grade applications. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, was used to store product and inventory data, providing fast and flexible access to this critical information. RabbitMQ, a message broker, was used to enable asynchronous communication between the various components of the system, ensuring scalability and reliability.

To secure the system, OpenID and Identity Server were used to implement single sign-on (SSO) and provide secure access to the system's resources. By integrating with existing authentication systems, the system provides a seamless and secure user experience.

Overall, the Catalog Inventory Trading Management System is a comprehensive and flexible solution for managing inventory and trading activities. Its use of modern technologies and microservices-based architecture ensures that it can be easily scaled and customized to meet the needs of any business.

References Introduction Background Overview of Heart Attacks A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. This blockage can be caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, known as plaque. When this occurs, the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, and the affected tissue begins to die. This can lead to severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. The most common symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. Other symptoms may include sweating, dizziness, and pain in the arms, neck, jaw, or back. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you experience any of these symptoms, as early treatment can prevent further damage to the heart.

Importance of Early Detection Early detection of a heart attack is crucial for preventing further damage to the heart and reducing the risk of complications. If a heart attack is detected early, medical treatment can be administered quickly

##### Introduction

###### 1.1 Background

Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, are a major cause of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve the chances of survival and recovery. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and may require specialized equipment or trained personnel. This project aims to develop a web application using machine learning techniques to detect heart attacks early, facilitating timely medical attention and intervention.

###### 1.2 Problem Statement

Heart attacks pose significant challenges in early detection due to their subtle and varying symptoms. Many individuals may not recognize the signs or symptoms of a heart attack until it is too late. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and blood tests, require specialized equipment and trained personnel, which may not be readily available in all healthcare settings. The project aims to address these challenges by developing a web application that leverages machine learning algorithms to detect heart attacks early and accurately, empowering individuals to seek timely medical attention and intervention.

###### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to create a web application that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect heart attacks early. The specific goals include:

1. Develop machine learning models that can accurately identify heart attack

Heart attack detection is an essential aspect of healthcare that aims to identify and diagnose potential cardiovascular events. The ability to detect heart attacks early can significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce mortality rates, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. Early detection of heart attacks involves monitoring various physiological parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. Technological advancements have paved the way for automated heart attack detection systems that leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these parameters. By continuously monitoring and analyzing patient data, these systems can detect abnormal patterns and alert healthcare professionals, enabling timely intervention and appropriate treatment.

Early detection of heart attacks has numerous benefits. It allows for prompt medical attention, which can minimize the extent of damage to heart tissue and reduce the risk of complications. By identifying potential heart attacks early, healthcare providers can initiate preventive measures, such as lifestyle modifications, medication, or interventional procedures, to mitigate the risk of future cardiac events. Early detection also enables closer monitoring and follow-up of high-risk individuals, ensuring timely adjustments to their treatment plans and enhancing their overall cardiovascular health.

The machine learning algorithms employed in heart attack detection systems have shown promising results in various studies. These algorithms can effectively analyze large amounts of patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions based on historical information. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown exceptional performance in analyzing ECG data and detecting heart attack patterns. Additionally, machine learning models can be trained on large datasets, enabling the development of personalized models that cater to individual patient characteristics and risk factors.

Heart attack detection systems using machine learning algorithms offer numerous advantages over traditional diagnostic methods. They can provide continuous monitoring, reduce human error, and automate the decision-making process. Moreover, these systems can be integrated into wearable devices, enabling remote monitoring and real-time alerts, even outside of clinical settings. This approach empowers individuals to take proactive measures in managing their cardiovascular health and seeking timely medical attention when necessary.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations and challenges associated with heart attack detection systems based on machine learning algorithms. One of the primary challenges is the availability and quality of data. Large, diverse, and accurately labeled datasets are essential for training and validating the algorithms. Obtaining comprehensive data from different demographic groups, ethnicities, and comorbidities is crucial to ensure the generalizability and reliability of the models.

Furthermore, there is a need for rigorous evaluation and validation of these systems in real-world settings. Collaboration between healthcare professionals, data scientists, and researchers is essential to ensure the clinical relevance, reliability, and safety of these systems. Ethical considerations, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias, must also be carefully addressed to ensure fair and responsible use of these technologies.

In conclusion, heart attack detection using machine learning algorithms holds great potential for improving early detection and intervention in cardiovascular events. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and data analytics, these systems can provide continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and personalized risk assessments. However, it is important to address the challenges associated with data availability, model validation, and ethical considerations to ensure the responsible and effective deployment of these technologies in healthcare. Ongoing research and collaboration will continue to refine and enhance the performance of heart attack detection systems, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and the advancement of cardiovascular medicine.

These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But it is too crowded.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks.

Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry). I am so much ready to be off this plane. ~ New York, is the place where many people's dreams come true. There are many places where you can visit New York and enjoy. I really want to tell people that they should visit here once at least.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks.

Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go.

I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But I would be lying if I said that I don't miss home. The people, the food, the parties.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

You can always turn SafeSearch on or off, depending on your preference, but turning it off will open your results up to explicit content. SafeSearch is one of the many tools Google uses to make the internet safer for users, but it’s not perfect. The feature may block content that doesn’t meet the criteria, or it may still show explicit content that isn’t filtered. Google also has a SafeSearch page where you can report if the feature isn’t working properly.

The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks.

There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.']

Retired to bed looking forward to tomorrow. ~ AM SUPER EXICITED TODAY MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE TO GO TO NEWYORK AM SO MUCH DELIGHTED TO ALIGHT FROM THE PLANE TO NEWYOK ~ Started my tour at the Statue of liberty. It was a wonderful sight but quite high. The harbour was fresh with the air of the sea. Went down to Queens to see the rich black culture.

She is so majestic and big. I went up to the top where I could see the whole bay area. The food here is so diverse as well. I had three different cultures of food for all my meals. I know this is cliche but I Love New York! ~ On the 25th of October 2022, I visited New York City. At 7:20 AM, I checked into Room Mate Grace Hotel Pool. The next stop after about an hour was the central park. I enjoyed the green nature of the park. I left Central Park for the MOMA museum around 11:20 AM. The museum tour took the greater part of the day. I enjoyed the rich history that the museum carries. What other better place to wind up the end than the Statue of Liberty? ~ A Visit to New York21st October 2022- I visited the Statue of Liberty and learned about the establishment year22nd October 2022- I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has three sites and the establishment year is 1870.I had interesting moments , they formed part of my memories. ~ The streets are filled early in the morning as people scramble to go to work.

All the things in the city are wonderful.I will never forget every part of the good things I found there. ~ Day 1 just woke up and I am already too excited about seeing those skyscrapers I heard of, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire state and many more. Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking.

I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But it is not a perfect place. It is too crowded.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Google has also outlined some additional updates it will be rolling out over the coming months, including adding a new section to its Safety Center that will include guides on privacy, security, and wellbeing for different age groups. Google will also be launching its own podcast series dedicated to online safety, and is releasing new educational resources in the US, the UK, and India to teach young children about digital safety. While Google will automatically blur explicit content in search results, the company notes that users can “report any images that appear in Search that you feel should be covered with a SafeSearch blur.” It’s also worth noting that the blur option isn’t a guaranteed way to block all explicit content from appearing in search results. Google’s new blur option won’t completely block explicit content from appearing in search results, and the company’s algorithm can still make mistakes. The blurring option is also only available for Google search results, and doesn’t extend to other services like YouTube or Google Maps, where explicit content may appear in search results. While Google’s new blur option is a welcome feature for those who want to avoid inadvertently stumbling across explicit content in search results, it doesn’t entirely solve the issue of inappropriate content appearing online. If you’re concerned about explicit content appearing on a specific website, you can report it to Google, which will review it and take appropriate action. In the meantime, Google’s new blur option is a step in the right direction, and should help to make the internet a safer place for everyone. Google is also introducing new privacy and security resources for children and families as part of Safer Internet Day. The company says that it’s expanding its Family Link and Be Internet Awesome tools to more countries and adding new features to help parents better manage their children’s online activity. The new features include a weekly email summary of a child’s screen time, app usage, and website visits, as well as a new “time limit” feature that lets parents set a maximum amount of time that their child can spend on a particular app or website. Google is also introducing a new “bedtime” feature that lets parents schedule a time when their child’s device will automatically go to sleep. The company says that it’s also working on new tools to help parents manage their children’s online activity, including a new “activity dashboard” that will provide parents with a more detailed overview of their

But indeed, this is a magnificent city. ~ Woke up in excitement to try out a new restaurant in this City. Hurriedly enjoyed breakfast and took a taxi to a local coffee house.

Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to be signed in to your Google account to access it. Google is also adding a new “About this image” feature to image search results, letting you learn more about an image before clicking on it. Once the feature is rolled out, clicking on an image will open a box on the right side of your search results, which includes information such as the image’s source URL, whether it’s similar to images you’ve previously searched for, and whether it’s commonly available on the web. In addition, Google says that if the image was used in a Google Maps image collection, you’ll see the original image and its source. The update is available on Google Images for English users in the US, and will be rolling out to other countries over the next few months. Google’s new blur filter comes as the company works to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its platforms. Google has previously supported the bipartisan EARN IT Act, which seeks to reform Section 230 protections for online platforms, as long as it didn’t remove end-to-end encryption in services like Gmail and Drive. In September, the company launched a new tool to help content moderators and tech companies automatically scan for CSAM in image and video files, using what Google says is the largest dataset of known CSAM content that’s available to the industry. According to Google, the new image scanning feature can help prevent people from sharing “unsafe” content and help them understand the context behind images they see on the web. “When searching for images, you’ll be able to learn more about the context of an image before you click on it, so you can make more informed choices,” Google wrote in its announcement. “We’ll start rolling this out in English in the US on Google Images in the coming months.” The update will be available for English users in the US first, with plans to expand to more countries over the next few months.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]
INFO:root:0 output text: <s> Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about Google is marking the occasion by revealing features designed to, well, make it safer to do things on the internet. The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9 percent of spam and phishing attacks. This includes blocking nearly 100 percent of spam from ever reaching your inbox, stopping nearly 15 billion bad messages a day. We also block 99.9 percent of threats from ever reaching your inbox, stopping nearly 100 percent of spam and phishing attacks. In fact, 2022 was one of the safest years on record, with Google Drive and Gmail stopping more than 1.8 billion dangerous files and links.

It’s important to keep in mind that not all AI is created

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking.

I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry). I am so much ready to be off this plane. ~ New York, is the place where many people's dreams come true. There are many places where you can visit New York and enjoy. I really want to tell people that they should visit here once at least. Anyhow, if I can get any chance to visit here I will come here again you visit here once As a tourist place, it is awesome to enjoy with fairly and friends. ~ New York, is one of the best places I have ever visited.there are many places where you can travel and enjoy yourself with your family and friend. I have never seen a place such beautiful and shining. If I have a chance to visit again here I will definitely come here one more time, I love this place and I can suggest you visit here once. This is one of the best tourist places I have ever visited. ~ 28/10/2022 New York. All the things I've heard of New York are true. The diverse culture, the food and the party scene are all too great. I wish I could spend more time here in this amazing place. People from all over the world are here. But everyone is busy and in a hurry to get somewhere. ~ Today I woke up very early in order to have enough time to check as many destinations as possible. Central Park was obviously the first on the list, being the closest to my hotel. I couldn't have missed the Statue of Liberty and also the Madison Square Garden where the New York Knicks play. Then I finished up by visiting the set of the movie Once Upon a Time in America. ~ I had always dreamt of seeing the famous New york City. Today, day had come. Standing on the roof top of Entire State Building, looking down, I saw how busy the street was.Ffrom people walking around doing business while others queued on the traffic. This is just a normal night in New York City. ~ This is my first time visiting the City That Never Sleeps. May I say that this isn't how I imagined it to be? Because what I've seen right now far exceeds my expectations. I can feel NYC embracing me like it isn't my first time visiting this place. I feel different from others here, yet I still fit. I think this will be my home away from home. ~ New York is a place I want to be to see the wonderful scenery. I have heard of you New York but now I want to see with my eyes. The wildlife, plants and the amazing people of New York. Above all I want to Make Friends with the New York people ~ Am writing this journal of New York. It was my wish to travel in New York.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

Keeping you safe on the web With 1 billion people using Chrome each month to search the web, we take your safety seriously. To that end, today we’re highlighting the importance of using Google Safe Browsing, which has helped protect billions of people from malicious websites since it launched 17 years ago. To better understand what that means, we’re sharing tips on how to check if a site is safe, and a new video on how to turn on Safe Browsing on desktop and mobile. We’re also expanding our Security Checkup to help you stay ahead of online threats by detecting security issues

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

In my opinion, there is no reason to read the provisions of the Act which use the word “person” as limited to those who carry out work of a particular kind. The reference to “persons” in these provisions is simply a reference to “persons” who fall within the ambit of the provision.

But indeed, this is a magnificent city. ~ Woke up in excitement to try out a new restaurant in this City. Hurriedly enjoyed breakfast and took a taxi to a local coffee house.

Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing, and malware from reaching their inboxes. Our advanced machine learning models and human reviewers can detect more than 100 new types of malware every day. And we’re constantly developing new technologies to fight back against new threats, whether they’re coming from criminals, hostile governments, or other bad actors. For example, we recently announced the launch of Project Shield, a program that defends independent media outlets and other at-risk organizations from DDoS attacks — one of the most common and disruptive forms of online harassment. We’ve also launched new capabilities like Cybersecurity Action Teams, a global team of security experts to help businesses defend against online threats. In the coming months, we’re launching new features to protect your online experience with Google, including:

- Blurred explicit images: In the coming months, we will be blurring explicit images in search results for all users, even if SafeSearch is not turned on. Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time.
- New security checkup: Our Security Checkup helps you review your Google Account settings and activity, like devices and third-party apps that can access your account, so you can spot and fix potential issues.
- Improved security alerts: In the coming months, we’re improving the security alerts we send to your email and phone. When we detect an important issue like suspicious activity or someone signing into your account from a new device, you’ll receive an alert to help you secure your account.

This is just a small part of the work we do to protect you online. At Google, we’re committed to building technology that works for you, and we’re investing in people, technology, and partnerships to keep you safe online. As always, we encourage you to stay informed and follow our Safety Center for the latest on online security.

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']

It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking.

A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~']

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google."]

And through the AI-driven technology of the Advanced Protection Program, we’re protecting users from sophisticated phishing attacks that use a range of techniques, such as impersonating legitimate brands and accounts, to trick users into providing sensitive information like passwords, which can then be used to steal user data. When it comes to account security, our goal is to provide the strongest protections possible for your personal data, which is why we’ve rolled out a variety of features like Google Password Checkup, which provides you with actionable guidance on how to improve your online security, including if you need to change any of your saved passwords. We’re also introducing a new feature to help prevent phishing attacks that use fake login pages to steal your Google password. Now, if you enter your password into a suspected phishing site, you’ll see a full page warning that your password was just compromised and you should change it immediately. The warning will also tell you what you can do to stay safe. With our new phishing detection, we can now warn you if your Google account credentials have been compromised in a data breach. And with the launch of the Password Import feature, you can now upload and check the strength of all your passwords in one go. This new feature will be available to all Gmail users over the next few months.

Each of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act. A “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. [20] 18. Ibid. 19. Section 9(1); "design compliance declaration[s]” are defined in s 8(1). 20. Sections 9(2) and (3). A “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act. [22] 21. Section 3; "building practitioner" is defined in s 7. 22. Section 13. A “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act. [25] 23. Section 3. 24. Section 32(3). 25. Section 32. A “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act. [28] 26. Section 3. 27. Section 34. 28. Section 35. A “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”. 29. Sections 3 and 7. There is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30] 30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited. “Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate. In the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described. There are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”. For example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act. Thus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not. In the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care. Thus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”. The references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”. As I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is: “construction work means any of the following— (a) building work, (b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work, (c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work, (d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.) The definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake. The definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake. The definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself. Finally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”. The potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.']
